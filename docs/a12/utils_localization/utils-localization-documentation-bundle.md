# Localization

## Introduction

The A12 localization library is a utility to provide localization & conversion functionality to A12-based applications.

The library leverages the possibility to add locale-specific translations in A12 models by providing integration with the model data structures.

## Overview

The A12 localization solution currently consists of two separate libraries:

* @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization
* @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-react

Both libraries are available as npm artifacts.
The latter one is an adapter that can be used to provide the localization functionality in a React context.

## Core Concepts

### Locale

A locale is an object that represents a specific geographical, cultural or political region.
It consists of a language and a country specifier, i.e. `en` and `US` for the English language in the United States of America.
The country specifier allows a differentiation between different variants of a language that depend on the (usually) geographical region.

Furthermore, we derive the concept of the `PartialLocale` from a locale. It only consists of a language specifier and is used as a fallback option during localization.

An application should always be configured to run with a "full" locale.

### Localizable

A `localizable` is an object that represents an entity which can be translated according to the locale of the application.

It contains a unique key for identification.

Furthermore, it can contain default translations, i.e. texts for a number of different locales.

Additionally, it can have `LocalizableArgs`. Those arguments are objects that are used to resolve placeholders in a translation.

### Placeholders

Any translation, either as a default text in Localizable object or provided from external source, can be a template string. I.e. it can contain placeholders that shall be resolved during localization. Those placeholders must be delimited by the dollar sign `$`. Note that only pairs of `$` are treated as placeholders.

For instance: "Hello, $userName$!".

If you have text inside `$` which you don’t want to treat as a placeholder, you can use `$$` instead to escape them. They will be displayed as a single `$`.

The aforementioned `LocalizableArgs`, that a localizable can contain, then represent the mapping of the placeholder name to the value that shall be inserted in its place.
There are different kinds of placeholders that are handled differently according to the semantics of their type.

Currently, the following types are supported:

* plain: The value for the placeholder will be inserted as it is.
* formattable: The value for the placeholder will be formatted according to the formatting options that were given with the placeholder object. These types of placeholders will usually be used with the ValueConversion object that can be passed to the localizer factory.
* localizable: The value of the placeholder will itself be localized. That is why the placeholder object again contains one or more localizables.
* dataFormat: The placeholder represents a specific data format. This is currently only used for error messages that should contain the format that is expected for specific inputs.

### Localizer

The `localizer` is the central function of the localization library. It takes one or multiple localizables as arguments and turns them into the localized string.

Many localized texts that shall be presented in the application UI are only based on a single localizable.
However, in some cases a fallback approach is desired. In this case, a list of localizables has to be passed.

### Localizer Factory

The localization library comes with a `defaultLocalizerFactory` that provides the localizer function with the A12-default localization algorithm.

This algorithm roughly works as follows:

* It goes through the localizables in the order they were passed.
* For each of the localizables, it tries to find a translation by going through the list of current locale and all fallback (partial) locales.

  + This is so-called `locale fallback`.
* For each locale, first any externally provided texts are searched.
* If no externally provided text is found, the default texts of the localizable object itself are searched.
* Only if no text could be found for any of the localizables in any of the locales, then undefined is returned.
* If a translation was found, the (optional) placeholders in the translation are replaced using the LocalizableArgs of the respective localizable.

### Locale Fallback

The locale fallback happens when a translation cannot be resolved for the locale of the application.
In this case, a list of fallback (partial) locales can be used to try to find a matching translation.

Usually, a fallback from a specific locale to a partial locale makes sense, e.g. from "en\_US" to just "en".

This fallback approach allows an efficient management of the actual translations for the locales that an application shall support.
I.e. all required translations are specified for partial locales (languages) and only specific translations are added for locales in those cases where they differ from the language default.

### Localization Tree (Map)

A `LocalizationTree` is a data structure to hold translations for a number of localizable keys.
The nodes of the tree represent the segments of a localizable key. The leafs of the tree contain the translations.

A `LocalizationTreeMap` is a mapping of locales to LocalizationTrees, i.e. a data structure that holds translations for multiple locales.
The LocalizationTreeMap is one means to provide translations to the defaultLocalizerFactory that can override A12-default translations.

### DataFormats

The `DataFormats` interface specifies the contents of a configuration object that holds the formatting specifics which should be used during localization and conversion.

This configuration is mostly interesting to be able to customize the formats of number and/or date (time) values in a UI.

It can also hold the configuration for how to represent the data formats themselves, e.g. for data format output in error messages.

A `DataFormats` object can be seen as a configuration for an application. It usually depends on the locale of the application since the representation of dates or numbers vary for different locales.

### ValueConversion

The `ValueConversion` object is a configuration object which holds the two conversion functions that can convert typed values to strings and vice versa.
These two functions are called formatValue and parseValue accordingly.

The functions can be used individually when parsing or formatting values and they can also be passed as a configuration to the localizer function in order to allow it to properly format placeholders in localizables.
Multiple A12 components will also rely on this conversion capability, e.g. when parsing user input in forms or when displaying data in a locale-specific formats.

The A12 localization library comes with a default implementation that covers all conversions that can be specified using the DataFormats configuration.

## Usage Scenario

The localization libraries are focused on providing localization & conversion to A12-based applications.

The following ideas shall help to achieve this with minimal efforts.

### General

Localization of a text is achieved by calling the localizer with one or multiple localizables.

The localizer itself is usually dependent on a specific locale. In most cases, this is the locale that the application is running in.
That means whenever the application locale changes, the localizer function should also change.
Of course, different parts of an application can use different localizer functions if the localization behavior should differ between these parts.

As a result of above points, the localizer calls do not require to pass the locale as a parameter.

Similarly, value conversions are done by calling the respective conversion functions. These usually depend on the DataFormats for a given locale.
Thus, this conversion object should also be updated when the application locale and its DataFormats change.

### React Integration

Since A12 is based on the React library, the `utils/localization-react` library offers an additional `LocalizerContext` to provide the localizer & conversion functions to React components.

There are two ways to provide this context:

1. The `DefaultLocalizerContextProvider` is a function that provides the context based on a locale and, optionally, a `DataFormats` configuration object function.
   In the most basic case, only a locale must be provided and internally the localizer function and value conversion object are then created and provided with this context.
2. The standard `LocalizerContext.Provider` that requires the full configuration object consisting of locale, dataFormats, value conversion object and localizer function.

This `LocalizerContext` should be wrapped around all parts of the application that require localization. Usually, it should be one of the outermost React components of the application.

Once the context is set up, all child React components can access the localizer and value conversion functions; and use them to render localized texts or convert values.

### Integration Into Redux Sagas and Middlewares

The localization solution is intended to be used almost exclusively in UI-related code, i.e. in React components.
The reason is that localization is a feature for the UI since it revolves around texts that will be presented to the user of the application.
Other texts (e.g. log output) should normally not require a localization.
That is also why the `LocalizerContext` is the central asset for integration into such code.

When (background) business logic produces localized texts, it should be checked whether this could be adapted to produce localizable objects instead.
After all, the localized texts are only really required when they can finally be displayed to the user.

However, in some rare cases one still might need to use the localizer function in internal business logic like redux sagas and middlewares.

In such cases, one could create an application-specific localizer factory function that should then be used to configure the React part of the application as well as the background processing in sagas and middlewares.
This centralization is necessary to avoid a discrepancy between the UI and internal processing.
The implementation of that factory function can, of course, make use of the `defaultLocalizerFactory` from the A12 localization library.
In most cases, the implementation will require access to the current locale, the data formats, the application-specific translations and the value conversion (for data formatting of localizable placeholders).

On the React-level, this factory function can be provided with the required parameters using the respective redux selectors.
Memoization is advisable here to avoid redundant re-renderings.

In sagas and middlewares, the same selectors can be used to create the localizer function with this central factory function.

#### Examples

##### Standard Use Case: Consuming the LocalizerContext

A React component is supposed to render some localized text. In order to achieve this, the localizer is retrieved from the `LocalizerContext` and called with the respective `Localizable`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` export function SampleComponent(props: { /* ... **/ }): JSX.Element { 	const localizer = React.useContext(LocalizerContext).localizer; 	const myLocalizedText = localizer({ 		key: "my.localizable.key", 		args: {}, 		defaults: { en: "My default text in English" } 	})  	return <div>{myLocalizedText}</div>; } ``` |
```

##### Custom Localization With Dedicated Context

A React component can create its own `LocalizerContext` and use it or pass it onto its child components.
This could be done, for example, to use a different locale in this part of the application.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` export function ComponentWithCustomLocalization(props: { locale: Locale }): JSX.Element { 	return ( 		<DefaultLocalizerContextProvider 			locale={props.locale} 		> 			<LocalizerContext.Consumer> 				{ 					l10nContext => 						l10nContext.localizer({ 							key: "abc", 							args: {}, 							defaults: { en: "Button Label" } 						}) 				} 				<SomeChildComponent/> 			</LocalizerContext.Consumer> 		</DefaultLocalizerContextProvider> 	); } ``` |
```

##### Completely Customized LocalizerContext

The `LocalizerContext` is setup in completely custom fashion which allows to specify a custom `localizer` function for the application.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 ``` | ``` const customDataFormatsProvider = (locale: Locale): DataFormats => { 	return { /** insert some custom implementation */}; }  const customLocalizerFactory = (locale: Locale, dataFormats: DataFormats): Localizer => { 	/** insert some custom implementation, sample below */  	// "debugging" localizer that returns the key of the first localizable and the locale itself 	// all text elements of the application UI will then show their primary localizable key 	return (localizable: Localizable) => { 		return `${localizable.key} (${Locale.toString(locale)})`; 	}; }  const customConversion: ValueConversion = { 	parseValue: (value, inputFormat) => { 		/** insert some custom implementation */ 		return { 			value: undefined 		} 	}, 	formatValue: (value, outputFormat) => { 		/** insert some custom implementation */ 		return "" 	} }   export function Application(props: { locale: Locale }): JSX.Element { 	const localizer = React.useMemo<Localizer>( 		() => customLocalizerFactory(props.locale, customDataFormatsProvider(props.locale)), 		[props.locale] 	);  	return ( 		<LocalizerContext.Provider 			value={{ 				locale: props.locale, 				dataFormats: customDataFormatsProvider(props.locale), 				conversion: customConversion, 				localizer 			}} 		> 			<ApplicationContent /> 		</LocalizerContext.Provider> 	); } ``` |
```

## Customization

Customization is possible on several levels: One can implement a completely custom localizer function or parameterize the creation of the localizer function with the help of the `defaultLocalizerFactory`.

### Custom Localizer Function

Of course, a custom localizer function can be implemented and used everywhere in the application. It just has to be passed to the respective components, e.g. via the `LocalizerContext`.
This approach could result in a lot of effort since all aspects of localization might have to be covered:

* Where to find the respective translations for a given localizable?
* How to resolve placeholders and formatting of (document) field values placeholders?
* How to achieve the locale fallback?
* How to achieve the fallback for localizables, i.e. when multiple localizables are passed in a localizer call?
* How to prioritize between translations that come with localizables and translation from external configuration?

If those aspects (mostly) do not apply for the specific application, the custom localizer function can be a good solution.
I.e. if all localization should be handled by an external service, the localizer function could just delegate to this service.

### Custom defaultLocalizerFactory Parameters

Another option is to customize the localizer function by making use of the various parameters of the `defaultLocalizerFactory`.

* Locale fallback resolving can be achieved by passing a list of fallback locales.
* Basic placeholder resolving is supported out-of-the-box by the defaultLocalizerFactory. However, proper (document) field value formatting can only be achieved by passing a `DataFormats` configuration object and a optionally also a `ValueConversion` object.
* A translation source can be passed to either

  + specify a `LocalizationTreeMap` that contains additional, application-specific translations that will be used with priority.
    I.e. overriding A12-default translation is achieved by passing a `LocalizationTreeMap` that contains custom translations for the same keys that localizables created by A12 components use.
  + or specify a `TranslationFinder` callback function which can implement a custom translation resolving algorithm.

## Utility Functionality

### Locales

The localization library provides the following functions to work with `Locale` and `PartialLocale` objects:

* `Locale.fromString()`: Creates a `Locale` object from its string representation, e.g. "en\_US".
* `Locale.toString()`: Returns the string representation of a (Partial-)Locale object.
* `Locale.isLocale()`: Type guard function to check whether a given object is a `Locale` object.
* `Locale.isPartialLocale()`: Type guard function to check whether a given object is a `PartialLocale` object.

### Localizable Keys

Localizable keys are strings with a specific structure. The keys can be split into segments that are separated by the dot sign `.`.
E.g. the key `"documentModel.label.PersonModel.root.Person.name"` could refer to the label of a "name" Field in a document model "PersonModel".

This structure is necessary for interoperability with e.g. the `LocalizationTreeMap` tree data structures. Within these trees, the segments of the keys refer to the names of the tree nodes.

However, the segments could themselves contain the `.` character. For instance, when a document model name is used as a segment and this model name contains this character.

In order to support such use cases, two utility functions can be used to provide (un-)escaping of the `.` character (and the backslash character `\` which is used as the escape character):

* `localizableKeyFromSegments`: This functions turns a given list of segment strings into a valid localizable key with all necessary escaping applied.
* `segmentsFromLocalizableKey`: This function splits a given localizable key into its segments and un-escapes all occurrences of escaped `.` and `\` characters.
* `addDotEscaping`: This functions returns the given string with all occurrences of `.` and `\` escaped.
* `removeEscaping`: This functions returns the given string with all escaping undone.

### Localizable Creation

There are two built-in factory functions to create localizables:

* `localizableFromModel`: This function creates the localizable object using the translations of the given `LocalizedModelText`.
  I.e. the localizable defaults are based on the translations that were specified in the respective A12 model element.
* `localizableFromLocalizationTreeMap`: This functions creates the localizable object based on a given key and a `LocalizationTreeMap`.
  I.e. the localizable defaults are taken from respective path in the given LocalizationTreeMap.

Of course, localizables can also be created in custom fashion as e.g. inline object literals or using custom factory functions.

### LocalizationTree & LocalizationTreeMap

These interfaces provide the possibility to specify translations in an efficient tree data structure.

Within A12 we often use it in the following way:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 ``` | ``` export const RESOURCE_KEYS: { 	dialogs: { 		confirmation: { 			/** Key of the confirmation dialog title */ 			title: "",  			/** Key of the confirmation dialog message */ 			message: "",  			/** Key of the confirmation dialog confirm button label */ 			confirm: "",  			/** Key of the confirmation dialog cancel button label */ 			cancel: "" 		}, 		genericError: { 			/** Key of the generic error dialog title */ 			title: "",  			/** Key of the generic error dialog message */ 			message: "",  			/** Key of the generic error dialog close button label */ 			close: "" 		} 	} } initializeKeys(RESOURCE_KEYS);  const en: typeof RESOURCE_KEYS = { 	dialogs: { 		confirmation: { 			title: "Confirmation required", 			message: "Do you want to submit your changes?", 			confirm: "Submit", 			cancel: "Discard" 		}, 		genericError: { 			title: "An unexpected error occurred", 			message: "The following error occurred: $errorMessage$", 			close: "Close" 		} 	} };  const de: typeof RESOURCE_KEYS = { /* German translations */ };  export const DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS: LocalizationTreeMap = { en, de }; ``` |
```

The function `initializeKeys` injects the complete localizable keys into the leafs of the `RESOURCE_KEYS` tree structure.
It can then be used in e.g. the rendering code to refer to the localizable keys of the translations with code completion support.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Since the localization tree node names are joined together to form a localizable key, they may not contain the `.` or `\` characters as explained in the section above. If they are, however, supposed to contain it to match certain naming conventions, they must use the escaped formats: `\p` or `\\`. |

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` // exemplary section of a render code for a generic error dialog  const titleLocalizable = localizableFromLocalizationTreeMap( 							RESOURCE_KEYS.dialogs.genericError.title, 							DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS 						); const messageLocalizable = localizableFromLocalizationTreeMap( 								RESOURCE_KEYS.dialogs.genericError.message, 								DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS, 								// this specifies the value for the $errorMessage$ placeholder 								{ errorMessage: { type: "plain", value: genericError.message } } 							);  const title = localizer(titleLocalizable); const message = localizer(messageLocalizable);  // ... ``` |
```

### Placeholders

The function `resolvePlaceholders` can be used to replace all placeholder occurrences in a given string with the values from a given object that maps the placeholder names to their respective values.

## Breaking Change Management

For the localization libraries the general [A12 breaking change interpretation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/breaking_change_management) applies.

## Migration Instructions

### 2025.06-ext4

#### Deprecation

##### Deep import paths of A12 Localization npm packages

Nested imports from the npm packages `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization` and `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-react` (e.g. `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization/lib/main/index.js`)
are now deprecated in favor of top-level imports to avoid unnecessary breaking changes and reduce ongoing maintenance effort.

The ability to use the old-style ("long") imports will be removed in the next breaking release.

To migrate, first install or update the codemod with your preferred package manager, e.g. with `pnpm`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` pnpm install -g @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-codemod ``` |
```

Then run the specific recipe:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` utils-localization-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json>  // or as a single command pnpx @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json> ``` |
```

For further details, run the codemod with the `--help` flag.

### 2025.06-ext2

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please be aware that due to changes in A12 internal api, you should not use this version of localization without Kernel version 30.3.0 which is also part of the 2025.06-ext2 coordinated and end-to-end tested release |

### 2025.06

#### Breaking Changes

##### singleDateAllowed removed

Deprecated property DateRangeConversionConfig.singleDateAllowed was removed and DateRangeConversionConfig.singleDate is now required.

##### Forbid false as confirm type value

The formatValue function of ValueConversion used to allow `false` as a valid value for confirm types (it was treated analogous to `null`). This special handling was removed and formatValue will now throw an error in this case.

##### Default FallbackLocales Implementation Changed

In the `defaultLocalizerFactory`, the default implementation for looking up fallback locales has been changed to not return Locales or PartialLocales of the language "en", if the given locale is of a different language.

Now, by default only PartialLocales of the same language are returned.

This was changed since it was an unusual default fallback behavior which could lead to a mix of different languages in the application ui.

If your application uses the defaultLocalizerFactory and relied on this fallback to english, it is easy to restore the old behavior by providing custom fallbackLocales when you configure your localizer:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` const localizer = defaultLocalizerFactory({ 	locale, 	fallbackLocales: createFallbackLocales(locale) });  function createFallbackLocales(locale: PartialLocale): PartialLocale[] { 	if (Locale.isLocale(locale)) { 		if (locale.language === "en") { 			return [{ language: "en" }]; 		} else { 			return [{ language: locale.language }, { language: "en" }]; 		} 	} 	if (locale.language !== "en") { 		return [{ language: "en" }]; 	} 	return []; } ``` |
```

##### Migration to ESM

The npm artifacts `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization` and `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-react` were migrated from CommonJS to [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules). When using Node `22.12+` and modern build tools, there should be no changes necessary to your bundler setup.

Migrating your own application to ESM is not required, but recommended. Consult the documentation of your bundler for specifics.

##### Updating to ES2024

The javascript output of the npm artifacts was updated from `ES2020` to `ES2024` to be able to use latest language features. When using supported browsers, there is no change necessary. If support for older browsers is required, make sure to include necessary polyfills.
