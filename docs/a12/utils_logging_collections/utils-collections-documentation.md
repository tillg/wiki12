# Collections

The package `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections` contains collection types with Set and Map semantics.

While standard JavaScript objects as well as ES6 Maps work fine as long as primitive keys are used, they do define key identity. This means, whenever two objects that share the same identity are used as key of a Map or an JS object, they are treated as two distinct entities (for Map this is due to same value zero comparison for key instances).

That being said, this collections library is of use to you in case:

1. you are looking for a map data structure that you want to use with your own complex data types as key
2. you are looking for a set with the same thoughts in mind
3. you are looking for a sorted set that also allows to use complex values

In those circumstances this collection library can help you.

## Breaking Change Management

The utils-collections package follows the general [A12 breaking change interpretation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/breaking_change_management).

## Migration Instructions

### 2025.06-ext4

#### Deprecation

#### Deep import paths of A12 Collections npm package

Nested imports from the npm package `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections` (e.g. `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections/lib/ComparativeSortedSet.js`)
are now deprecated in favor of top-level imports to avoid unnecessary breaking changes and reduce ongoing maintenance effort.

The ability to use the old-style ("long") imports will be removed in the next breaking release.

To migrate, first install or update the codemod with your preferred package manager, e.g. with `pnpm`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` pnpm install -g @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections-codemod ``` |
```

Then run the specific recipe:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` utils-collections-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json>  // or as a single command pnpx @com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json> ``` |
```

For further details, run the codemod with the `--help` flag.

### 2025.06

#### Breaking Changes

#### Migration to ESM

The npm artifact `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-collections` was migrated from CommonJS to [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules). When using Node `22.12+` and modern build tools, there should be no changes necessary to your bundler setup.

Migrating your own application to ESM is not required, but recommended. Consult the documentation of your bundler for specifics.

#### Updating to ES2024

The javascript output of the npm artifact was updated from `ES2020` to `ES2024` to be able to use latest language features. When using supported browsers, there is no change necessary. If support for older browsers is required, make sure to include necessary polyfills.

#### Typo In DfsTopology method

The method `hasCylce()` of the `DfsTopology` class was corrected to `hasCycle()`. Please update the name accordingly.

#### Removed Deprecated API

The deprecated method `connectVertex()` of the `DirectedGraph` class was removed. Please use `connectByVertex()` instead, which accepts the same parameters.
