|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This documentation belongs to an **A12 Enterprise Component** which is not part of the Open Source offering (A12 Community Edition). Please feel free to browse the documentation and learn more about how you can use this A12 component in your project. Learn more about the benefits from an A12 Enterprise Subscription on [the Editions & Licensing page](https://geta12.com/#/editions-licensing). |

## Introduction

The A12 Content Management System (CMS) allows content managers to create, publish, maintain pages with their corresponding meta-data and content as well as organize pages in a hierarchical structure.
It provides components and API to render these pages and to use the page hierarchy to render the equivalent navigation for end users.

The CMS is a lightweight application module that can be integrated into A12 applications. Please refer to [CMS developer documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/CMS/cms-dev-docs/index.html#_getting_started) for detailed integration instruction.
The CMS uses the Content Engine and the Content Model Editor - lower level components, which can also be used for other purposes, which are documented separately.

## Key Concepts

### Content Model

The Content Model is an UI model which focuses on presenting a web page or a section of a web page within A12 application.
It shares the same structure as other models in A12 platform with two root fields: `header` and `content`.
The `header` field includes metadata: `modelType`, `id`, `modelVersion`, `locales`, `labels`, and `annotations`.
The `modelType` for Content Models is set to `"content"`. The `content` field is nested and organized hierarchically,
allowing for complex structural definition of layout and web elements.
This model ensures the consistency across different applications within the platform, facilitating the integration and
rendering of web content.

### Content Engine

The Content Engine is designed to read the Content Model and render the corresponding elements based on
the defined structure and properties. It interprets the hierarchical content configuration,
which mimics the structure of HTML or React elements, and dynamically generates the visual representation of the page.
This allows content managers to create and configure web pages without writing code,
as the engine automatically handles the presentation of configured elements.

### Content Editor

The Content Editor is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of editing Content Models within the A12 platform.
Instead of dealing with raw JSON files, users can visually manage and configure the structure and properties of their content elements.

It allows users to add, delete, duplicate, and move elements within the structure tree, providing a dynamic and flexible content organization.
The editor also features a real-time preview, enabling users to see changes instantly.

Additionally, it allows for easy editing of each element’s configuration and properties, making content customization straightforward. This robust tool integrates seamlessly into the A12 platform, making it an indispensable asset for content managers aiming to create and maintain high-quality web content efficiently.

### Content Management System

The CMS is a broader concept compared to the Content Editor.
It is designed to create, manage and modify the hierarchical organization of pages and fragments.
The CMS is also responsible for managing the content in each page and fragment by using the integrated Content Editor.

#### Pages

Within our Content Management System (CMS), *Pages* are the central entities that define the structure and content of your website.
Pages allow users to manage web content efficiently, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience.
The CMS supports various page types and provides detailed metadata to control the behavior and appearance of each page,
making it a versatile tool for content managers and developers alike.

##### Page Types

The CMS supports four distinct types of pages, each tailored to specific needs:

* **Content Pages**: These pages enable content managers to create and edit the actual content displayed on a webpage. They are ideal for static content that needs regular updates.
* **External Pages**: These pages simply link to external websites. They are useful for directing users to resources outside the main website.
* **Custom Pages**: These pages offer developers complete control over the page views, allowing for extensive customization beyond the standard templates and configurations.
* **Dynamic Pages**: Designed for use within regular A12 applications, these pages support dynamic content that changes based on user interactions or data inputs. (*experimental*)

##### Page Metadata

Each page within the CMS is associated with a set of metadata attributes that help define its identity and behavior:

* **Name**: The unique identifier for the page from the user’s perspective. It helps users recognize and differentiate between various pages.
* **Label**: This metadata is displayed in the web browser tab title and the top navigation bar menu, providing a clear and concise description of the page’s content.
* **Path**: A string that is concatenated with other paths from root pages down to the current page, constructing the final URL for the page. This ensures a logical and hierarchical structure for the website’s navigation.
* **Sidebar**: A configuration option that allows users to choose whether the sidebar should be shown or hidden on the page. This is particularly useful for creating a more focused and streamlined user experience.

#### Fragments

Besides pages, the CMS includes a powerful feature called *Fragments* which are reusable components that
can be created and updated similarly to content pages but are designed to be embedded into other pages.
The main purpose of fragments is to promote content consistency, efficiency, and modularity across the website:

* **Consistency**: By using fragments, content managers can ensure that specific sections of content remain consistent across different pages. This is particularly useful for headers, footers, and other common sections that appear on multiple pages.
* **Efficiency**: Fragments help avoid content duplication, making it easier to update and manage content. Instead of editing the same section on multiple pages, content managers can update the fragment once, and the changes will propagate automatically.
* **Modularity**: Fragments promote a modular approach to content management, allowing for more flexible and maintainable website structures. Content managers can mix and match fragments to build complex pages without redundant content.

## Core Functionalities

The CMS offers a range of core functionalities designed to streamline the management of web content.
These functionalities provide users with the necessary tools to create, organize, configure,
and publish pages efficiently. Additionally, the CMS supports all default A12 themes,
allowing the visual appearance of content pages to adapt dynamically based on the selected theme of the end application.

### Managing Pages

Managing pages is a fundamental aspect of our CMS, allowing users to handle all aspects of page lifecycle management from creation to publication.
All page management tasks can be performed within the Pages menu, ensuring a centralized and intuitive user experience.

Figure 1. Pages tree

#### Organize Pages

The CMS enables users to organize pages hierarchically, ensuring a logical structure for the website.
Users can rearrange pages using a drag-and-drop interface, making it easy to maintain an intuitive navigation system.
This hierarchical organization supports nesting, allowing for complex page structures that reflect the website’s architecture.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When a page is dragged and dropped into another page, the parent page MUST NOT contain a child with the same path to avoid conflicts. |

#### Create Pages

Inside a content page node, users can click the insert button at the end of the parent node or
right-click and choose "Insert Sub Page" from the context menu.
This action will open a dialog where the user can select from different page types (content, external, dynamic, custom) to suit their specific needs.
Specify the properties for the new sub-page, ensuring that new pages can be quickly added and integrated into the site.

#### Configure Page Metadata

Each page in the CMS can be configured with detailed metadata to control its behavior and appearance. Metadata fields include:

* **Name**: The unique identifier for the page from the user’s perspective.
* **Label**: Displayed in the web browser tab title and the top navigation bar menu.
* **Path**: Constructs the final URL by concatenating strings from root pages to the current page. Pages within the same parent must have unique paths to avoid conflicts.
* **Hide Sidebar**: A option to configure whether the sidebar should be shown or hidden.

These metadata configurations ensure that each page is properly identified and displayed according to user preferences and site requirements.

#### Publish pages

Publishing pages is a critical step in making content available to the public.
The CMS manages the publication process by providing tools to control the visibility of pages.
Users can preview pages before publishing to ensure everything is correct and make any necessary adjustments.

Within Pages tree, the publication status of each page is shown in the Status column.
Users can select Publish/Unpublish action button in correspondence with each page to change their visibility.

### Managing Fragments

All actions mentioned in this guide will be carried out through the Fragment menu.
This menu provides a centralized location for managing various aspects of fragments,
ensuring a streamlined and organized approach to handling fragment-related tasks.

#### Create Fragments

Users can navigate to the Fragments menu and initiate the creation of a new fragment.
The process involves specifying the fragment’s name, label, and initial content.
Fragments can be designed to include various elements similar to regular content pages, such as text, images, and layout elements,
which can be reused across multiple pages.

#### Edit Fragments

Editing fragments allows users to update and refine the content of existing fragments.
Users can select a fragment from the Fragments menu and open it in the editor.
All editing actions are similar to those available in the regular Content Editor used for content pages,
ensuring a consistent and intuitive editing experience.

Changes made to a fragment are automatically reflected wherever the fragment is embedded.
This feature is particularly useful for making global updates to commonly used content sections,
such as headers, footers, and promotional banners.

#### Embed Fragments

Embedding fragments into content pages is a key functionality that enhances content reuse and management.
To embed a fragment, users need to open the target content page in the editor,
then select the target fragment element within the page and choose the desired fragment name from a dropdown list.
This action embeds the selected fragment into the content page,
and any updates to the fragment will be reflected in all instances where it is used.

### Manage Content

For more information, refer to the
[Content Modeling documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/CONTENT_ENGINE/contentengine-user-docs/index.html).

#### Cross-Reference Links

The CMS allows you to create cross-reference links between different pages and/or direct users to specific headings within the same application.

##### Creating Cross-Reference Links

To create a cross-reference link to another page:

1. Insert a regular link element in the CMS
2. Choose between two link types using the radio button:

   * **External**: Creates a link to an external URL
   * **Cross-reference**: Creates a link to another page within the same application

When you select the *Cross-reference* option, two dropdown fields will appear:

* **Page** (required): Select the target page you want to link to
* **Anchor** (optional): Select a configured heading anchor within the target page to jump to

![cross reference link](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/cms/cms-user-docs/assets/images/cross-reference-link.png)

Figure 6. Cross reference link configuration

In this example, when a user clicks the configured link, they will be directed to the Home page and automatically scroll to the "Get Started" heading within that page.

##### Configuring Heading Anchors

To make a heading available as a link target:

1. Open the heading element configuration panel (in the target page)
2. Set the **Anchor** field with a descriptive name (e.g., "get-started", "overview")

When users click the cross-reference link, the application will navigate to the target page and automatically scroll to the selected heading anchor, if specified.
