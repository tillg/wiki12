# Print Modeling

This documentation is intended for a business analyst audience.

## Introduction and Concepts

The Print Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor and enables domain experts and analysts to create and modify Print Models. These models are designed to function as templates for generating PDF-documents from A12 Platform data.

Print Models describe the layout, styling and content of the resulting PDF-documents.
The Print Model Editor differentiates itself from a common text editor by its design around the insertion of *dynamic content* from the A12 Platform.
Print Models can facilitate simple data insertions as well as complex dynamic calculations based on the inserted data.
Examples range from in-line text insertions and tables, to element repetition, rule-based element hiding and listings with completely customizable content and styles.

**Accessibility Hint**
The Print Engine will generate PDF documents with tagged elements for accessibility software like screen readers, which are aligned with the standards PDF/UA and PDF/A-3a.

However, to ensure that the resulting PDF document is fully compliant with these standards, the modeller must follow the accessibility hints provided in this documentation. These are mandatory for compliance; if they are not implemented, the PDF will not meet PDF/UA or PDF/A‑3a.

Figure 1. The Print Model Editor

### Installation

The Print Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor.
For advice on the installation of the Simple Model Editor, refer to the "Quick Start Guide" on getA12 under "Modeling".

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To create or edit a Print Model, use the Simple Model Editor (SME) version `11.5.0` or higher, which is provided with the A12 version `2024.06-ext4` or higher. |

### Migrating Existing Models

It might be necessary to migrate existing Print Models in case a new version of the Simple Model Editor and thus Print Model Editor has been installed.

In most cases, the Simple Model Editor can handle updating versions itself.
For more information, refer to the documentation of the Simple Model Editor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Since Print Model version `2.1.0`, the SME handles the migration automatically. If a workspace in the SME contains old models that need to be migrated, an error will appear with prompting messages. Click the `Resolve All Issues` button to automatically update them. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Print Model files older than version `2.1.0` must first be migrated using the Java-based print-shell tool. Follow the [print-shell migration instructions](#PrintShellMigration). |

### Print Model

A Print Model functions as a template for PDF-representations of inserted Documents.

The resulting PDF-document structure is defined by the Segments modeled in the [Segment Tab](#SegmentTab).

The PDF can be further modified by modeling Sections and Watermarks in the [Section Tab](#SectionTab) and the [Watermark Tab](#WatermarkTab).

Text Styles defined in the [Text Styles Tab](#TextStylesTab) will also affect the final look and feel of the PDF-document.

When modeling [Segments](#SegmentTab), [Sections](#SectionTab) and [Watermarks](#WatermarkTab), Print Model Elements are used to define the content of the PDF-document.
These Elements are added to the [Editor Stage](#EditorStage) and positioned in the millimeter grid. The individual settings of each element can be modeled as described in [Editors for Model Elements](#PrintModelElement).

**Accessibility Hint**

Please be aware that it is currently not possible to manually define the reading order of elements for screen readers. However, if you need this ability in your project, please reach out to the Print Engine team, so that they can consider it for future updates.

Print Model elements can utilize references to data from Document Models, allowing dynamic content to be displayed in the PDF.
For this purpose, you can reference a Document Model in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

### Concepts

#### Positioning & Layout

[Print Model Elements](#PrintModelElement) are positioned on a millimeter grid.
Each element has a user defined width and an initial height based on its pre-determined content.
If an element contains dynamic content, its height can change, which means the content below the element might be pushed downwards.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Print Model Editor millimeter grid might not have correct measures when measured on your display. The display measures are dependent on the type of your display and do not affect the resulting PDF-document. |

Based on their relative positions, elements define a so-called *bottom margin*.
A value that defines the area below an element, that will be kept empty below the element when it comes to repositioning and element collisions.
In some cases also a *top margin* is necessary.

##### Example

In the [following figures](#MarginLayoutFigures) a scenario is displayed, where both margins are necessary to keep the expected layout stable during the insertion of dynamic content.
If the user places the elements **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** like in the left figure, the margins displayed in the right figure are created automatically by the editor.

Each element has a *bottom margin* that keeps the empty space between the elements stable.
A top margin for element **B** is created, because element **A**'s bottom margin only extends to element **C**.
This leaves the empty area between element **A** and element **B** partially uncovered.
Therefore, a *top margin* is created for element **B**, which covers this area.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Margin layout example  Figure 2. Margin layout example without displayed margins. | Margin layout example with margins  Figure 3. Margin layout example with displayed margins. |

#### Templates and Settings

You can use Print Model References as [Templates](#PrintModelTemplates) in other Print Models.
This allows you to define regions with a set height and static layout, enabling the creation of Print Models that conform to various standards (e.g. DIN standards).

The available Fonts can be centrally managed using a Print Settings Model. These fonts can then be easily selected in the Print Model when configuring [Text Styles](#TextStylesTab).

#### Dynamic Content

Print Model elements can utilize references to data from Document Models, allowing dynamic content to be displayed in the PDF.
For this purpose, you can reference a Document Model in your Print Model.
This allows you to use data from Documents based on this Document Model to add dynamic content in a variety of different ways:

* Field References
* Computations
* Expressions

The Print Model Elements such as Tables and Listings can be used to display repeatable data.
When rendering the Preview, the repeatable data will cause rows to be automatically created based on the modeling settings that have been made.

#### Preview

The [Preview](#Preview) may be used to generate a PDF preview of your model.
If dynamic content has been referenced in the model, you may select a Document to the Preview which will then be used as the source of the dynamic content.

### Committing Changes

When using the PME, the editor works **directly** on the selected workspace.
Changes to the workspace files are automatically reloaded by the PME.
Changes in the PME are saved in temporary `.wal` files.
These files function as the editors change history which is used by features like *Undo* and *Redo*.

Print Models with saved in a `.wal` file are marked in the Workspace Explorer of the Simple Model Editor with and Icon, "The model has uncommitted changes".

To finalize made changes, a user can *commit* them to the Print Model in the [Commit Changes Tab](#CommitChangesTab).
This applies the changes to the Print Model, validates the resulting model and, if successful, deletes the `.wal` file and overwrites the Print Model in your workspace.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This procedure persists even temporary changes in case of system crashes, editor closing or validation problems. Every change a user makes is reflected directly in the workspace which is helpful during support requests and bug reports. When making such inquiries, please make sure to add your Print Model and any relevant `.wal` file. |

## Print Model Editor

This chapter serves as an overview over the basic features and views of the Print Model Editor.

### Overview

The Print Model Editor can be divided into 4 main areas:

1. Editor Header
2. Sidebar
3. Tab
4. Editor Stage

#### Editor Header

The Header of the Print Model Editor contains the following buttons.
These can be found in the top right-hand corner of the editor:

Undo
:   Reverts the last change in the current view.

Redo
:   Reverts the last **Undo** in the current view.

Errors
:   Shows the number of error messages for the current Print Model.

Warnings
:   Shows the number of warning messages for the current Print Model.

Print
:   Opens the [Preview](#Preview) for the current Print Model.

Close
:   Close the Current Model

#### Sidebar

The Sidebar serves as the main navigation.
The Sidebar can be used to open the following tabs:

1. General
2. Schema
3. Text Styles
4. Segment
5. Section
6. Watermark
7. Commit changes

The standard "Save", "Cancel" and "Deploy" buttons are present at the bottom of the Sidebar. In the Print Model Editor, the "Save" button at the bottom of the sidebar opens the [Commit Changes Tab](#CommitChangesTab).

#### Tab

Once an item is selected in the Sidebar, the respective Tab is opened.
The Tab may be maximized, minimized or closed using the buttons in the top right-hand corner of the Tab.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Only Tabs with an [Editor Stage](#EditorStage) may be maximized, minimized or closed.  The "General", "Text Styles" and "Commit Changes" Tab therefore do not have these options. |

#### Editor Stage

The Editor Stage is used for placing and editing Print Model Elements.
The Editor Stage can be accessed from the following tabs:

* [Segment Tab](#SegmentTab)
* [Section Tab](#SectionTab)
* [Watermark Tab](#WatermarkTab)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Editor Stage is shown when the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab) is open to give a better overview of the current model.  Placing and editing of the Print Model Elements should nevertheless be made through the respective tabs to ensure the correct Segment, Section or Watermark is being edited. |

There are two modes available in the Editor Stage: [Stage Mode](#StageMode) and [Layout Mode](#LayoutMode). Effortlessly switch between them using the conveniently located buttons at the top of the Editor Stage.

![Switch the Editor mode](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_editor_modes.png)

Figure 4. Switch the Editor mode

##### Stage Mode (Default)

The Stage Model allows Print Model Elements to be moved, resized and their content edited.
Each Print Model Element is edited with a dedicated Detail Editor as described in [Editors for Model Elements](#PrintModelElement).

![Add element library](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_add_element_toolbar.png)

Figure 5. Add element library

New Elements can be added by clicking on the "Element Library" in the top-left of the Editor Stage and dragging and dropping the desired Element onto the Editor Stage whilst in "Default" mode.

Existing elements can be moved and resized by drag and drop.
Alternatively, the position or size may be precisely defined using the following settings in the Element Stage header:

* Position Top
* Position Left
* Width
* Height

Right-clicking an Element opens a Context Menu with the following options:

* Copy
* Delete
* [Group into Area](#GroupIntoArea)
* [Hide Conditions](#HideConditions)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Print Model Elements may be copied or deleted using:  * "Delete selected elements" and "Copy selected elements" buttons in the Element Stage header * Keyboard shortcuts, Delete and Ctrl+C |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Copied Elements may be pasted by:  * Right-clicking on the Stage and selecting "Paste" in the context menu * Keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+V |

To open the detail view of an element, you can double-click the element, or select the element and click the "Open Detail Edit" button in the right-hand corner of the Stage Header.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Editor Stage options  Figure 6. Editor Stage options | Element context menu  Figure 7. Element context menu |

###### Group into Area

This feature allows users to group multiple selected elements into an Area element, enabling them to be affected by the [Page Break Behavior](#PageBreakBehavior) configuration of the new Area.

To group elements into an Area:

1. Select multiple elements in the Editor Stage.
2. Right-click and select "Group into Area" from the context menu, or click the "Group selected elements into Area" button in the right-hand corner of the Stage Header.

The selected elements will be grouped into an Area element.

When elements are grouped into an Area, their [Page Break Behavior](#PageBreakBehavior) settings are automatically adjusted:

* Elements whose page break behavior’s source is **Default** will be changed to **Inherited**, inheriting the page break behavior from the new parent Area.
* Elements whose page break behavior’s source is already **Inherited** will continue inheriting, but now from the new parent Area instead of their previous parent.
* Elements whose page break behavior’s source is **Input** will remain unchanged, keeping their explicitly defined page break behavior.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * The "Group into Area" option is disabled when selecting a single Area, Bounding Box, or Switch element. Since these elements already function as containers, wrapping a single container in another Area would create redundant nesting without providing additional functionality. |

##### Layout Mode

The Layout Mode is used to view and modify margins for existing Print Model Elements.
This allows precise control of the layout as described in [Positioning & Layout](#PositioningLayout).

The margin values are displayed at the top and bottom of the element.

The margin value can be adjusted by:

* Drag and drop
* The input fields in the Editor Stage header

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Top and Bottom margins added in the Layout Mode will also be displayed in the Stage Mode (Default). |

![Adjust margins](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_adjust_margins.png)

Figure 8. Adjust margins

### General Tab

In the General tab, the meta information of the model can be edited.
The following properties can be edited in this tab:

Description
:   The internal description of this Print Model.

Roles
:   The allowed roles for this Print Model.

Annotations
:   The annotations of this Print Model.

You can select roles from the workspace by clicking the btn:[Add] and selecting
an option from the dropdown. Roles can be deleted by clicking the red button in the row
and confirming your choice.

#### PDF Metadata

The PDF Metadata section allows you to configure PDF metadata fields that will be embedded in the generated document.
These metadata fields are essential for PDF/UA accessibility compliance, as they provide important document information for assistive technologies.
All metadata fields are configured as a list of [computation alternatives](#Computations), allowing for dynamic values based on Document Model data.

Document Model (optional)
:   The Document Model to use for metadata field computations. This determines which data paths are available for the computation operations.

Title
:   The title of the PDF document.

Description
:   The description/subject of the PDF document.

Author
:   The author of the PDF document.

Language
:   The language of the PDF document.

Each computation alternative consists of:

* **Operation**: A [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) expression that computes the metadata value. This can be a path reference to a field in the Document Model, a static value, or any valid Kernel Language calculation.
* **Precondition** (optional): A [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) expression that determines whether this computation alternative should be used. The computation is only applied if the precondition evaluates to *True*.

The computation alternatives are evaluated in order, and the first one with a matching precondition will be used.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Metadata Default values are automatically set for new Print Models. It is recommended to customize these metadata fields with meaningful values specific to your document to ensure proper accessibility compliance. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If all preconditions evaluate to *False* or produce an empty result, no metadata value will be set for that field. This will negatively affect PDF accessibility compliance. |

![General tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_general_tab.png)

Figure 9. General tab

### Schema Tab

In the Schema tab, the model references of the Print Model can be edited.
The Print Model can reference Document Models to allow for the inclusion of dynamic content.
An alias can be set for Document Model References, that allows for easier distinction of the referenced Models.

Additionally, you can add Print Model References to include template segments, and Typesetting Model References to manage typography settings.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The referenced Document Model must not contain dots in its name. It is possible to rename the Document Model or to use an alias without any dot to bypass this restriction. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can add multiple Document Models in the Schema Tab, but currently only one can be used as reference in the Print Model. |

Document Model References
:   The list of referenced Document Models and their optional alias in this Print Model.
    The "Open Setting" button may be used to update the given alias.

Print Model References
:   The list of referenced [Print Model Templates](#PrintModelTemplates). The Print Model Editor will only offer Print Models which conform to the [Template specification](#CreateTemplate).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If changes are made to the referenced Document Model, the field references used by the elements of the Print Model may become invalid. In such cases, you need to manually update the field references in the Print Model to ensure consistency.  Changes to referenced Templates will be detected when modeling a Segment which references the updated Template. This change will create updates that need to be committed. |

Typesetting Model References
:   The list of referenced Typesetting Models will be used for the Text Styles. Typesetting Models can be created using the [Typesetting Model Editor](#Typesetting).

![Schema tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_schema_tab.png)

Figure 10. Schema tab

### Text Styles Tab

In the Text Styles tab, Text Styles can be created, edited and removed.
The upper part of the Text Styles tab displays an example of the current Text Style, for which the properties can be edited below.
A newly created Print Model comes with a default Text Style which cannot be deleted.

The Text Styles that have been modeled are shown in the list on the left-hand side.

The currently selected Text Style is applied to the preview text at the top of the Text Styles view.
This Text Style can be edited using the modeling settings described below.

![Text Styles tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_text_styles_tab.png)

Figure 11. Text Styles tab

Click "Add New Text Style" in the bottom right-hand corner to add a new Text Style.

#### Text Style Settings

General configuration options for Text Styles:

Name
:   The name of the Text Style.
    Used to distinguish the Text Styles.

Semantic
:   The semantic purpose of the Text Style.
    Possible values are `Paragraph`, `Headline 1`, …​, `Headline 6`.
    Selecting a `Headline` semantic, will mark the [Text](#Text) elements that use the Text Style as headings for accessibility purposes.

**Accessibility Hint**
In order to improve navigation and readability it is important to use the correct semantic structure for your headlines, subheadings and paragraphs.

If you want to create a heading, select the appropriate `Headline` semantic based on the heading level. You can only use `Headline 2` as a subheading after `Headline 1`, `Headline 3` after `Headline 2`, and so on.

If you want to create a new standard paragraph Text Style, select the `Paragraph` semantic.

The relationship between font size and line height is crucial for readability, especially for people with visual impairments, dyslexia, or cognitive disabilities.
We recommend a line height of at least 1.5 times the font size, with a minimum recommended font size for body text of 12 pt.

#### Typography Settings

Options that affect the appearance and behavior of text:

Typesetting Model
:   Specifies the typesetting model applied when this Text Style is used.
    Available models are added via the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab)

Static Hyphenation
:   Applies language-specific hyphenation rules to text.
    Available options include:

    * en\_US: English
    * de\_1996: German (with the hyphenation rules that were introduced with the spelling reform of 1996)
    * fr: French
    * cs: Czech
    * pt: Portuguese
    * vi: Vietnamese

Font
:   The font family of the Text Style.
    The available fonts are defined during the initial setup of the Print Engine.
    Extra fonts can be added using a [Print Setting Model](#ConfigureCustomFonts).

Font Size
:   The font size of the Text Style in `pt`.

Line Height
:   The line height of the Text Style in `pt`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Typesetting Model and Static Hyphenation are not compatible with the [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) in the [Preview](#Preview). |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If a Text Style employs a font that has not been configured in the Print Engine, any elements applying that Text Style will be displayed and printed with the default font. |

#### Custom Fonts

As described in [Setting Model Configuration](#SettingModelConfiguration), Print Engine empowers you to configure your own fonts.
Those fonts will be synchronized from the Print Settings Model in your workspace and can be used in Print Model Editor.
The customized fonts will be available in Print Model Editor, and can be used to define [Text Styles](#TextStylesTab).

![Text Styles tab with custom fonts](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_utilize_custom_fonts.png)

Figure 12. Text Styles tab with custom fonts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In the event that any text styles in your print model were previously associated with fonts not present in the new customized list, a notification toast will promptly alert you to these inconsistencies. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To ensure the consistency, take a moment to reselect those fonts for affected text styles. Elements associated with these styles will adopt the default font if not addressed. |

![A Text Style that uses un-configured font](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_text_style_employ_unconfigured_font.png)

Figure 13. A Text Style that uses un-configured font

### Segment Tab

In the Segment Tab, Segments can be created, edited, reordered and deleted.

Model Segments are containers for elements that each result in one or more DIN-A4 pages in the PDF document.
Multiple Segments may be added to the Print Model and each segment starts on a new page and defines the page orientation of these pages.

The Segments will be added to the final Document in the Order that they are shown in the Segment Tab.
Existing Segments can be modified using the following buttons:

Open Setting
:   Edit the Name or Repeatability Settings of the selected Segment.

Open Editor
:   Open the [Editor Stage](#StageMode) to edit the Segment’s content.

Open Menu
:   Duplicate
    :   Duplicate the selected Segment.

    Delete
    :   Delete the selected Segment.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Clicking on the Segment in the List will also cause the [Editor Stage](#StageMode) to open. |

A Document Model Group can be selected as a data context in the Segment Settings.
If the selected group is repeatable, then the Segment will be repeated for each instance of the repeatable group in the provided Document, with each instance creating a new page.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Repeatable Segment: Select Document Model  Figure 14. Repeatable Segment: Select Document Model | Repeatable Segment: Select repeatable Group  Figure 15. Repeatable Segment: Select repeatable Group |

New Segments may be added at the bottom of the List.

Name
:   The Name of the new Segment

Orientation
:   * Portrait
    * Landscape

Template Segment (optional)
:   A [Template](#PrintModelTemplates) from one of the referenced Print Models in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Once a Name and Orientation have been given the "Add" button must be clicked to add the new Segment to the list of Segments.

![Segment tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_segment_tab.png)

Figure 16. Segment tab

#### Print Model References (Templates)

You can use Print Model References as Templates in other Print Models.
This allows you to define regions with a set height and static layout, enabling the creation of Print Models that conform to various standards (e.g. DIN standards).

##### Create Template

To create a Template, you need to create a Print Model with a [Segment](#SegmentTab).
This Segment can be used to define the layout of your Template using [Bounding Box](#BoundingBox) elements.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A Print Model Segment can only be used as a Template Segment if it contains only Bounding Box elements or nested Bounding Box elements. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A Template Print Model can include multiple Template Segments. |

##### Use Template

To use a Template, you must add an existing Template Print Model in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab) to your current Print Model.
The Segments of the Template can then be used as Template Segments in your current Print Model.

![Select Template Segment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_select_template_segment.png)

Figure 17. Select Template Segment

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If changes have been made to the Template, the Print Model Editor automatically reloads the Template each time you visit a Segment that uses it. This will create updates that need to be [committed](#CommittingChanges). |

### Section Tab

In the Section tab, Sections can be created, edited and deleted.

Sections are optional containers for elements that result in headers and footers in the resulting PDF document.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you chose to model Sections, it is often easier to model the Section first and then the Segments. |

Which Section is applied to which page is defined by the two central properties of the Section:

Page Orientation
:   A section is only applied to pages of the selected page orientation.

Section Usage
:   A section is either applied to only the first page of the PDF document, or to all remaining pages.
    This allows the definition of a specific header & footer for a cover page.
    On first pages, sections that are specifically marked for the first page are prioritized.

Each combination of *Page Orientation* and *Section Usage* properties has a specific slot listed in the Section tab.
Modeling a Section leads to the modeled header and footer areas being grayed-out in the respective [Segment](#SegmentTab).

Sections may be added and modified with the following buttons:

Add
:   Add a Section for this *Page Orientation* and *Section Usage*.

Open Editor
:   Open the [Editor Stage](#StageMode) to edit the Section’s content.

Delete
:   Delete the selected Section.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Clicking on the Section in the List will also cause the [Editor Stage](#StageMode) to open. |

![Section tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_section_tab.png)

Figure 18. Section tab

### Watermark Tab

In the Watermark tab, watermarks can be created, edited, and deleted.

Watermarks are optional containers for elements that result in overlays on their respective segments.
There are two watermarks that can be set according to segment orientation: portrait and landscape.

Watermarks may be added and modified with the following buttons:

Add
:   Add a Watermark for this *Page Orientation*.

Open Setting
:   Edit the Opacity or the Conditions under which the selected Watermark is shown.

    Opacity
    :   Define the opacity of the element of the watermark pages

    Condition
    :   Using  [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html)
        to define conditions. If any of the conditions are evaluated as true, or no condition is defined, the watermark will be printed.

Open Editor
:   Open the [Editor Stage](#StageMode) to edit the Watermark’s content.

Delete
:   Delete the selected Watermark.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The attachments of [Listing Element](#Listing) are not added to the end of the document when used inside a Watermark. |

![Watermark tab](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_watermark_tab.png)

Figure 19. Watermark tab

### Commit Changes Tab

In the Commit Changes tab, the pending changes of the Print Model can be committed and thus finalized.
The top of this tab shows the change history, a list of changes made in the editor.
To commit the changes the user can make a selection in the change list and then click the "COMMIT SELECTED CHANGES AND TRUNCATE HISTORY" button.

Pre-default, all changes are selected.
To de-select a change, click on the Status of the Change to toggle the Status from "Commit" to "Pending".

On the right-hand side, validation errors related to the selected changes are displayed in an error tree.
By clicking on the "Go to" icon of an error in the tree, the user will be navigated to the place where the error has occurred.

![Commit Changes](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_commit_changes_tab.png)

Figure 20. Commit Changes tab

### Preview

When the "Print" button is pressed, the Print Preview window will open for the currently open Print Model. You can have a preview window open simultaneously for each print model in your workspace.

This screen displays the resulting PDF preview. The PDF is automatically reloaded when [committing](#CommitChangesTab) changes to the Print Model or when the preview settings are changed.

#### Preview Settings

At the top of the Preview, there is a toolbar that provides the following settings for the resulting PDF Preview:

Test Document
:   Select a Document (from Workspace Data) based on the Document Model referenced in the Print Model to use for printing.

Reload Button
:   Manually regenerate the PDF with the current preview settings.

Localization Dropdown
:   Change the locale of the resulting PDF. Locale options are obtained from the referenced Document Model used for printing.

Time Zone Dropdown
:   Change the time zone of the resulting PDF. The user’s current time zone is selected as the default and appears first in the dropdown list.

Switching Rendering Mode
:   Switch between [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) and the new rendering mode for the preview. Legacy Rendering is not compatible with Typesetting Models and language-specific hyphenation rules.

Using Print model with pending changes
:   Used to generate the preview with pending changes, which will re-render the PDF with each change made in the editor. When toggled off, only committed changes will be displayed.

![Preview window](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter02/02_preview_window.png)

Figure 21. Preview window

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The PDF Preview can be downloaded or printed using the standard buttons in the top-right hand corner of the Preview. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can create Test Documents in several ways:  * Using **Ad Hoc Testing** in the Document Model Editor * With the **Form Model Preview** in the Form Model Editor * From the documents available in **Workspace Data**  Please refer to the Document or Form Modeling Documentation for more details. |

#### Legacy Rendering Mode

The Legacy Rendering Mode is an alternative rendering pipeline in the `PrintEngine`.
It is incompatible with advanced features like [Typesetting Models](#TypeSettingModel) and will be deprecated in the 2026.06 release.

To disable/enable the different rendering modes, you can use, depending on the context, the toggle button in the [Preview](#Preview) toolbar, the flag in the [Print-Shell](#print_shell_printing) or the variable in the Print Engine configuration (see [PrintJobManager](https://geta12.com/docs/PRINT_ENGINE/print-technical-documentation/index.html#print_job_manager)).

##### Noticeable Differences in the Legacy Rendering Mode

1. Table Rows are spread over a page break instead of being moved completely to the next page if possible
2. Image Elements that are larger than a page will not be scaled down to fit the page size
3. Watermarks are also applied to attachment pages
4. Attachments are printed, whether or not they are linked inside the main document body
5. If a text can not be printed with the selected font or the defined fallback font, it will instead be printed with Open Sans
6. Expression elements background color will apply to the whole element area, not just the text area
7. Listing Property Computations can use other color descriptions beside hex color codes (e.g. "red", "blue", etc.)

##### Performance Differences

According to our benchmarks the Legacy Rendering Mode is generally slower than the default rendering mode.
However, the performance can vary based on the specific Print Model and Document used.

### Validation

The Print Model is automatically validated after every user interaction to ensure consistency and correctness.
This includes two layers of validation:

* **Internal Validation**:
  Ensures the Print Model structure is valid and complete.
  This includes checks for required fields, value ranges, and correct formats.
* **Reference Validation**:
  Checks whether references to Document Models are valid.
  This includes all field references (e.g. fields in Text Elements, Tables, …​) and computations (formulas that refer to fields in the Document Model).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | References inside Expression elements are currently not validated. |

Validation errors are displayed directly in the Editor to provide immediate feedback.
The modeler must resolve all validation errors, otherwise it is not possible to print or commit the changes.

## Editors for Model Elements

This chapter describes the Print Model Elements that may be added, edited and deleted in the [Editor Stage](#EditorStage).

### Common Properties of Print Model Elements

#### Detail View

The Detail View allows the editing of the properties of each specific Element.
The modeling options available in the Detail View is determined by the type of element that has been selected.

The Detail View has no "Save" button, since every change is saved automatically to the [commit history](#CommitChangesTab).
Simply click on "Close" in the top right-hand corner of the Detail View or select the next Element in the Editor Stage.

![Element Detail View](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_text_detail_view.png)

Figure 22. Element Detail View

##### Input Source

This feature allows users to explicitly define the source of values, enhancing data clarity and input control.

By specifying the value source, it resolves ambiguity between unset and default values and clarifies contexts that affect the value. Users can make informed decisions by understanding the precise origin of values in their results, preventing confusion or incorrect assumptions.

There are four types of sources applied to fields:

* **Default**: The default value will be used for the field
* **Input**: The value is provided by the user
* **Unset**: No value will be assigned
* **Inherited**: The value is inherited from its parent

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Source Default  Figure 23. Input Source Default | Input Source Input  Figure 24. Input Source Input | Input Source Unset  Figure 25. Input Source Unset | Input Source Inherited  Figure 26. Input Source Inherited |

You can change the input source by hovering over the currently selected input source icon. The available options will appear, allowing you to select a different source.

Refer to the table below for fields that apply the input source and their respective source types.

Table 1. Input source fields


| Element | Field | Source | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | **Default** | **Input** | **Unset** |
| **Table** | Max row count | ✘ | ✔ | ✔ |

Table 2. Text properties source fields


| **Text Properties** | **Default** | **Input** | **Inherited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Style | ✔ (value: Default Text Style) | ✔ | ✔ |
| Bold | ✔ (value: true for header properties, otherwise false) | ✔ | ✔ |
| Italic | ✔ (value: false) | ✔ | ✔ |
| Underline | ✔ (value: false) | ✔ | ✔ |
| Color | ✔ (value: #000000) | ✔ | ✔ |
| Background Color | ✔ (value: #ffffff) | ✔ | ✔ |

#### Text Properties

Allows the definition of properties affecting the text portions of the element.

Text Style
:   Selection of a [Text Style](#TextStylesTab).

Bold, Italic, Underline
:   Toggles the respective property.

Color
:   Hexadecimal code for the text color.

Background Color
:   Hexadecimal code for the background color of the text.

Alignment
:   Selection of a text alignment.

    * Left
    * Center
    * Right
    * Justify

![Text Properties detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_text_properties_detail_view.png)

Figure 27. Text Properties detail view

When the source is Default, the default values are applied. See the table in [Text Properties Source Fields](#TextPropertiesInputSource) for details.

#### Border Properties

Allows the definition of a border around the element.

Border Width
:   Sets the width of the border in `pt`.

Border Style
:   Sets the style of the border.

    * None
    * Solid
    * Dashed
    * Dotted

Border Color
:   Hexadecimal code for the border color.

![Border Properties detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_border_properties_detail_view.png)

Figure 28. Border Properties detail view

#### Hide Conditions

Hide Conditions allow the definition of conditions that will hide elements from being displayed in the resulting PDF document.
The Hide Conditions can be edited by right-clicking an element and selecting the "Hide Conditions" option.
The conditions are written as [Computations](#Computations) in the [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) syntax.
It is expected that the condition returns a boolean value, where *True* leads to the element being hidden.

If an element is hidden from being displayed in the resulting PDF document, the elements below the hidden element are move upwards as much as possible.

![Hide Conditions detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_hide_conditions_detail_view.png)

Figure 29. Hide Conditions detail view

##### Example

Consider the example displayed below, that was introduced in the [Margin Layout example](#MarginLayoutFigures).

* If element **A** is hidden by a Hide Condition, all elements below are moved upwards a distance equal to the height of element **A,** and it’s bottom margin.
* If element **B** is hidden, no other element is moved.
  Element **D** cannot be moved upwards, since it is blocked by element **C,** and it’s bottom margin.
* If element **C** is hidden, no other element is moved.
  Element **D** cannot be moved upwards, since it is blocked by element **B,** and it’s bottom margin.
* If element **B** and **C** are hidden, element **D** is moved upwards a distance equal to element **B**'s height and bottom margin.
* If element **A**, **B** and **C** are hidden, element **D** is moved upwards to the initial position of element **A**.

#### Computations

Computations in Print Models use the [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) syntax to dynamically calculate values or evaluate conditions.
Depending on the context, computations in the Print Model serve different purposes:

##### Conditions

Used for conditionally showing or hiding content. This can be used in:

* [Hide Conditions](#HideConditions) - to conditionally hide elements
* [Switch Cases](#Switch) - to conditionally display different content
* [Watermarks](#WatermarkTab) - to conditionally display watermarks

##### Computation Alternatives

Used for computing dynamic values. This can be used in:

* [Calculation Elements](#Calculation) - to compute and display dynamic values
* [Listing Elements](#Listing) - to compute cell values and properties

Each Computation Alternative consists of:

Precondition
:   A condition that must evaluate to *True* for the operation to be applied. If no precondition is specified, the operation is always applied.

Operation
:   The expression that computes the result value.

The Computation Alternatives are evaluated in order, and the first one with a matching precondition (or no precondition) will be used.

##### Referencing Document Model Data

In computations, you can reference fields and groups from the Document Model using their paths:

```
[CustomerDM/customer/firstName]
```

##### Document Model Metadata Fields

In addition to referencing Document Model fields and groups, you can access metadata properties of Document Model elements using the `metadata/…​` prefix.

```
metadata/<element-path>/<metadata-field>
```

For example, to access the `label` metadata of a field at `/customer/firstName`:

```
[metadata/customer/firstName/label]
```

This would return the localized label of the field, e.g. "First Name".

###### Available Metadata Fields

The following metadata fields are available:

Table 3. Available Metadata Fields


| Metadata Field | Applies To | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `required` | Fields, Groups | Whether the element is required. Returns a boolean value. |
| `externalDescription` | Fields, Groups | The external description of the element. |
| `path` | Fields, Groups | The path of the element as a string with leading and trailing slashes (e.g. `"/customer/addresses/"`). |
| `label` | Fields only | The label of the field. |
| `repeatability` | Groups only | The repeatability setting of the group. |
| `errorMessage` | Enumeration Fields only | The error message defined for the enumeration field. |

##### Annotation Fields

You can also access annotations of Document Model elements using the `annotations/…​` prefix:

```
annotations/<element-path>/<annotation-name>
```

For example:

```
[annotations/customer/firstName/myCustomAnnotation]
```

##### Listing-specific Computation Fields

The [Listing Element](#Listing) supports additional computation fields for accessing information about the current row’s entity.
See [Additional Computation Fields](#ListingAdditionalFields) in the Listing documentation for details.

#### Page Break Behavior

Page break behavior allows users to define how an element interacts with page breaks in the resulting PDF document.
This setting is only available on the [Segment Tab](#SegmentTab). To edit it, double-click the element in the [Layout Mode](#LayoutMode) to open the Detail View. The page break behavior options are located under the page break settings.

![Page Break Behavior detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_page_break_behavior_detail_view.png)

Figure 32. Page Break Behavior detail view

The [Input Source](#InputSource) is used to define the source for the page break behavior value. There are three sources available:

* **Default**: The default value is applied. The default value is **Allow**.
* **Input**: The user can select between the two behavior options described below.
* **Inherited**: The value is inherited from its parent element. This is only applicable for elements inside container elements (Bounding Box/Area/Switch).

The page break behavior options are:

Allow
:   The element can be split across pages.

Avoid
:   The element will not be split across pages.

    * **For container elements** (Bounding Box/Area/Switch): If the element (including gaps between child elements and child elements that are also set to 'Avoid') falls on a page break, the whole element is pushed to the next page, even if it won’t fit completely.
    * **For standalone elements**: If the element falls on a page break, it is pushed to the next page to avoid splitting. If it won’t fit on the next page at all, it remains in its current position.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For repeatable Areas and Switch elements, the page break behavior is **not** applied to the entire element, but rather to each repetition/case of the element. This means that if an Area or Switch is set to **Avoid**, each repetition/case of that Area or Switch will try to avoid being split across pages, but different repetitions/cases may end up on different pages. |

If an element is set to **Avoid**, it is indicated by a small icon in the top right corner of the element in the Layout Editor Stage.

![Page Break Behavior Indicator](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_page_break_behavior_indicator.png)

Figure 33. Page Break Behavior Indicator

##### Default Input Source for New Elements

* In the Segment stage: When creating a new element, the page break behavior’s source is set to **Default**.
* In the stage of container elements (Bounding Box/Area/Switch): When creating a new element, the page break behavior’s source is set to **Inherited** and references the page break behavior of the container element containing it.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The page break behavior is not available on [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) |

### Text

The Text element displays text in the resulting PDF.
The content of the Text element can consist of static text and dynamic inline insertions:

* [Field](#Field)
* [Calculation](#Calculation)
* [Page Number](#PageNumber)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Page Number elements are only available on Text elements that are placed inside [Sections](#SectionTab). |

The Text element content is defined using the rich text editor. The following settings are available in the header of the rich text editor.

Bold
:   Sets the formatting of the currently selected text to bold.

Italic
:   Sets the formatting of the currently selected text to italic.

Underline
:   Sets the formatting of the currently selected text to underlined.

Color
:   Sets the color of the currently selected text to the color displayed in the hexadecimal color code picker immediately to the right.

Background Color
:   Sets the color of the currently selected text to the color displayed in the hexadecimal color code picker immediately to the right.

Field
:   Adds the reference to a Field from a referenced Document Model using the [Field](#Field) Editor.

Calculation
:   Adds the result of a Calculation based on data from the Document using the [Calculation](#Calculation) Editor.

Remove font size inline styles
:   Removes any inline `font-size` styles from the text.
    This is useful when pasting content from external sources that override the standard styling.

Additionally, the Text element is configurable using [Border Properties](#BorderProperties) and a subset of the [Text Properties](#TextProperties).

If all dynamic inline elements evaluate to an empty value, you have the option to hide the Text element. To enable this behavior, select the option `Hide this element if all nested entities are empty`.

**Accessibility Hint**

For accessibility purposes, there are some recommendations when modeling Text elements:

* use the correct semantic text style for headings and paragraphs, e.g. `Headline 2` can only be used as a subheading after `Headline 1`, etc.
* avoid using italics or underlining
* do not use text alignment "Justified"
* ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background if you use custom colors
* do not use text colors alone to convey information (e.g. red for errors), use icons or additional text instead
* do not refer to other text segments by visual information only (for example, do not use "see below"). Instead, use links or spell out the headline of the respective paragraph (`See chapter 5.1 of this document`).
* copying lists (as in `bullet-point list`) from other sources into the text editor does not create the correct semantic accessibility structure for lists in the output PDF. If you have this requirement in your project, please reach out to Print Engine team.

![Text element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_text_detail_view.png)

Figure 34. Text element detail view

#### Field

The Field element can insert the content of a Document Model Field instance into the resulting PDF document.
The content of the selected Field instance will be evaluated and returned as a formatted string.
The formatting of the string is determined by the Field Type settings below.

Add a Field element by clicking on the "Field" Button in the rich text editor of a [Text](#Text) element.

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Field
:   Navigate to the desired field by expanding Groups in the selected Document Model then click on the Field

Field Type
:   The formatting can be modified based on the Field type of the instance, by selecting one of the following types:

    * **Text (no selection):** Displays the data of a Field instance as plain text without any formatting.
    * **HTML:** Formats a Field instance containing HTML content. HTML tags are processed and rendered in the resulting PDF.
    * **Date:** Formats a Date Field instance into a readable date format based on the locale. The formatting can be customized by defining a specific pattern for evaluation. For example, the pattern `YYYY.MM.dd` evaluates to e.g. `2025.02.17`, while the pattern `dd’th of' MMMM YYYY 'at' HH:mm 'o''clock'` evaluates to `17th of February 2025 at 13:54 o’clock`.
    * **Date range:** Formats a DateRange Field instance into a readable format based on the locale. The formatting of the start date, end date, and separator can be customized by defining an evaluation pattern.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | You can find more thorough information about evaluation patterns for dates by clicking the Info Icon next to the pattern input field or by reading through the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html). |
    * **Checkbox:** Formats a Boolean Field instance based on its value. You can specify which value should be displayed for `true` and `false`.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | To display special characters such as ☐ or ☑ as the display value for the checkbox type, ensure that the selected [Text Style](#TextStylesTab) uses a font that supports these characters. The Print Model Editor provides the font [Noto Sans Symbols](#DefaultFonts), which is compatible with these symbols. |

Suffix
:   Model a suffix for the formatted string data.

Click "Back" to return to the Text Editor.

Figure 35. Field detail view

#### Calculation

The Calculation element can insert the result of a [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) into the resulting PDF document.
The Kernel Computation functions analog to computations in Document Models.
If the [Computation](#Computations) does not return a String, the result type of the computation must be explicitly defined by the user to allow the default formatting options to be applied.

Add a Calculation by clicking on the "Calculation" Button in the rich text editor of a [Text](#Text) element.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Calculation Element is not a replacement for Computations of Business data and does not provide the same Level of accuracy as Computations within a Document Model. |

Name
:   The Name of the Calculation

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Field Type
:   The result of the Calculation is, by default, assumed to be a String.
    If the result is of another type, the Field Type property needs to be set.
    The following Field Types are available using this configuration:

    * Boolean
    * Number
    * String
    * TypeDefinition

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If TypeDefinition is selected, a TypeDefinition from the selected Document Model must be specified. |

Formatting Type
:   If a Field Type is specified, a Formatting Type may additionally be set.
    The options are similar to the String formatting options offered in the [Field](#Field).

Suffix
:   Model a suffix for the formatted string data.

Precondition and Operation
:   A Computation Table is modeled as described in the [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) Documentation.

Click "Back" to return to the Text Editor.

Figure 37. Page Number and Total Page Number in a Section

### Line

The Line element inserts a horizontal line into the resulting PDF document, which functions analog to the HTML `<hr>` element.
The properties of the Line element are determined by its [Border Properties](#BorderProperties).

### Table

The Table element inserts a table into the resulting PDF, which points to a selected repeatable group in a referenced A12 Document Model.
Each row of the resulting table corresponds to one instance of the repeatable group.
The Table can have any number of columns, but needs at least one column to be displayed correctly.
Each column can have a title, which will be displayed in the header and is based on an Element type:

* Field
* Expression

If a column is marked as a *sum column*, one additional row will be generated at the bottom of the table, which will contain the sums of each sum column.
To indicate this last row as a sum row, you can define a *sum label*. This label will be rendered in the first column of a table if at least one *sum column* is defined in the other columns of the table.

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Group
:   The path to the Group in the Document Model that defines the root of the Table Element.
    Every row of the Table Element corresponds to one repetition of this Group.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Only Groups can be selected, that are either non-repeatable or are repeatable Groups that are not children of other Repeatable Groups. |

Columns
:   Each Column of the Table Element pertains to a defined nested Element.
    Click "Add" to add new columns or click on the Column in the table to edit it.
    See [Columns](#TableColumn) for more details.

General Properties
:   Maximum Row Count
    :   Numerical value that specifies the maximum number of rows that will be generated for the Table Element.
        Click "Unset Value" to skip this setting.
        See [Input Source](#InputSource) for more details on these settings.

    Sum Row Label
    :   A String label that is displayed in the first cell of the row containing the results of the Sum Columns.
        If the Sum Row Label is unset, no label will appear.
        See [Input Source](#InputSource) for more details on these settings.

        |  |  |
        | --- | --- |
        |  | If the first Column is marked as a Sum Column, the row will not have a label. |

Filtering
:   Filter Expression
    :   A filter expression that applies a filter on the set of rows.
        Its syntax conforms to the Filter Expression Syntax used in the Form Model.
        The row is displayed if the condition is fulfilled.

Additionally, the Table element is configurable using [Border Properties](#BorderProperties) and separate configurations of [Text Properties](#TextProperties) for the header and body of the table.

#### Columns

Element type
:   The type of this Element must be selected as it defines the content of the respective Column.

    * **Field**: Each cell of the column is inserted directly from a specific field instance, analog to the [Field](#Field) element.
    * **Expression**: Each cell is the result of an expression evaluated on the repeatable group instance, analog to the [Expression](#Expression) element.

Label
:   The label of the Column in the Table Element header.
    See [Input Source](#InputSource) for more details on these settings.

    * **Default Value**
    * **User Input**

Hide label?
:   Hides the label for this column

Width
:   Percentage width of the Column in respect to the Listing Elements width.
    If no width is set, the default HTML-table behavior is applied.
    The value must be an integer between 1 and 100.
    The sum of all widths will also be validated to ensure that it is 100 or less.

Sum Column
:   Marks the Column to be summed up at the bottom of the table.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | A Column can only be marked as a Sum Column, if the Element Type is a Field that is a Number Field. |

Click "Back" to return to the Table Editor.

**Accessibility Hint**

For accessibility purposes, a table element should have more than one column and more than one row.

Do not use the "Hide Label" option for columns and the "Hide Header" option for the table.

### Image

The Image element inserts an image into the resulting PDF.

Image source type
:   The image data can be inserted from two different sources:

    * [Attachment](#Attachment)
    * [Field](#ImageField)

Alternative Text
:   The text that will be accessed by screen readers.
    This is required for accessibility purposes.

Height
:   The height in millimeters that the image will be scaled to.
    If not set, the image height will be scaled according to its aspect ratio with respect to the provided image width.

Width
:   The width in millimeters, that the image will be scaled to.
    This is required for images with source type *Field*.

**Accessibility Hint**

For accessibility standards, the alternative text should be short but descriptive of the image content. For info graphics the description can be more extensive.

Do not use images that contain important textual information (exception for logos), use the text element instead.

#### Attachment

The image content is uploaded in the Print Model Editor as an image attachment. This way the image will be stored as static content in your Print Model.
The original image dimensions are used if they are not overwritten by the user input. If only the `width` property is provided by the user (with leaving the `height` property empty), the image will be scaled while keeping the original aspect ratio.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The supported image formats are: `GIF`, `BMP`, `JPEG`, `JPG`, and `PNG`. When using `GIF` images, only the first frame will be displayed in the PDF. |

![Image element detail view using attachment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_image_attachment_detail_view.png)

Figure 42. Image element detail view using attachment

#### Field

The image content is inserted from an A12 field instance during the printing process, allowing the image to be dynamically sourced from Document Model data.
The content of the field instance must be a valid base64-encoded string to be correctly rendered in the resulting PDF.

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Field
:   Navigate to the desired field by expanding Groups in the selected Document Model then click on the Field.

    The following Fields from the Attachment Group should be selected when referencing Attachments from the Document Model:

    * `content` Field when using Attachments in Embedded mode.
    * `attachment_id` Field when using Attachments in Reference mode.

### Listing

The Listing element inserts a tabular representation of a specific subtree of a Document into the resulting PDF.
Each row of the generated table corresponds to one field or group instance of the selected Document.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Due to the complex nature of the customization options, the Listing Element is recommended for more experienced users.  Consider modeling a [Table](#Table) if the use-case allows it. |

The columns of the table are configured on the Listing Element.
The cells content and styles are defined by [A12 Kernel Computations](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) set in the respective column configuration.
These computations are executed on the respective field or group instance of the row to determine its result values.

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Group
:   The path to the Group in the Document Model that defines the root of the Table Element.
    This Group and every Group or Field inside it will be generating a row in the resulting table.

Columns
:   Each Column of the Table Element pertains to a defined nested Element.
    Click "Add" to add new columns or click on the Column in the table to edit it.
    See [Listing Columns](#ListingColumn) for more details.

Row Property Computations
:   Property Computations may be modeled that apply to each row of the Listing. See [Property Computation](#PropertyComputation) for more details.

Group Property Computations
:   Group Property Computations may be modeled that apply to the selected Group Instance. See [Group Property Computation](#GroupPropertyComputation) for more details.

Additionally, the Listing Element is configurable using [Border Properties](#BorderProperties) and separate configurations of [Text Properties](#TextProperties) for the header and body of the Listing.

![Listing element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_listing_detail_view.png)

Figure 45. Listing element detail view

#### Listing Columns

Column label
:   The label of the Column in the Table Element header.
    See [Input Source](#InputSource) for more details on these settings.

    * **Default Value**
    * **User Input**
    * **Unset Value**

Column Width
:   Percentage width of the Column in respect to the Listing Elements width.
    If no width is set, the default HTML-table behavior is applied.
    The value must be an integer between 1 and 100.
    The sum of all widths will also be validated to ensure that it is 100 or less.

Sort group content by this column
:   The resulting table rows will be sorted by the content of this column.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | The nesting structure of the A12 Document will be kept intact by the sorting. The contents of any Group will be restructured regarding the sorting, but no instance within a Group will be moved outside. |

Column has custom text properties
:   Allows full configuration of the [Text Properties](#TextProperties) for the current column.
    The Text Properties are shown at the bottom of the Listing Column Editor.

Column has custom border properties
:   Allows full configuration of the [Border Properties](#BorderProperties) for the current column.
    The Border Properties are shown at the bottom of the Listing Column Editor.

##### Default Computations

A set of [Value Computations](#ValueComputations) and [Property Computations](#PropertyComputation) that will be executed if neither [Group Computations](#ListingGroupComputation) nor [Field Computations](#ListingFieldComputation) are holding for the rows respective instance.

Value Computations
:   A Computation Table is modeled to return a specific value under a specific set of conditions.
    See [Value Computations](#ValueComputations) for more details

Property Computations
:   Property Computations may be modeled that apply to each row of this Listing Column. See [Property Computation](#PropertyComputation) for more details.

![Listing column detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_listing_column_detail_view.png)

Figure 46. Listing column detail view

##### Group Computations

A set of [Value Computations](#ValueComputations) and [Property Computations](#PropertyComputation) that will be executed on any row corresponding to a Group Instance.

##### Field Computations

A set of [Value Computations](#ValueComputations) and [Property Computations](#PropertyComputation) that will be executed on any row corresponding to a Field Instance with a Field Type that matches the Document Field Type.

Select the field type of the results of the value computations
:   Expected input Field Type for the Field Value Computation.

Computation Output Type
:   Expected output Field Type for the Field Value Computations.
    The output of the Value Computation should match this Field Type.

Field Type
:   The formatting can be modified based on the Field type of the instance, by selecting one of the following types:

    * **HTML:** Formats a Field instance containing HTML content. HTML tags are processed and rendered in the resulting PDF.
    * **Date:** Formats a Date Field instance into a readable date format based on the locale. The formatting can be customized by defining a specific pattern for evaluation. For example, the pattern `YYYY.MM.dd` evaluates to e.g. `2025.02.17`, while the pattern `dd’th of' MMMM YYYY 'at' HH:mm 'o''clock'` evaluates to `17th of February 2025 at 13:54 o’clock`.
    * **Date range:** Formats a DateRange Field instance into a readable format based on the locale. The formatting of the start date, end date, and separator can be customized by defining an evaluation pattern.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | You can find more thorough information about evaluation patterns for dates by clicking the Info Icon next to the pattern input field or by reading through the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html). |
    * **Checkbox:** Formats a Boolean Field instance based on its value. You can specify which value should be displayed for `true` and `false`.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | To display special characters such as ☐ or ☑ as the display value for the checkbox type, ensure that the selected [Text Style](#TextStylesTab) uses a font that supports these characters. The Print Model Editor provides the font [Noto Sans Symbols](#DefaultFonts), which is compatible with these symbols. |

Suffix
:   Model a suffix for the formatted string data.

#### Value Computations

In addition to the Operators and Language Constructs in the
[Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) and the Fields and Groups in the referenced Document Model, the [Computations](#Computations) used in the Listing Element support the usage of [Additional Computation Fields](#ListingAdditionalFields).
The Additional Computation Fields allow the access of properties relative to the Field or Group instance of the current row.

##### Additional Computation Fields

The computations inside the complex listing support references to the following Fields to access information about the entity of the current row:

* `value` - reference to the value of the current Field. Not filled for Groups.
* `path` - reference to the path of the current Field or Group.
* `name` - reference to the name of the current Field or Group.
* `depth`: reference to the nesting depth of the current Field or Group inside the document model. Root Groups have `[depth] == 0`.
* `isField`: results in *True* if the current entity is a Field, *False* otherwise.
* `currentRepetition`: the repetition index of the current entity.
* `repetitions`: the repetitions value of the current entity.
* `relativeMetadata/…​`: prefix for accessing the [Metadata](#MetadataFieldsInComputations) of the current entity.
* `relativeAnnotation/…​`: prefix for accessing the [Annotations](#AnnotationFieldsInComputations) of the current entity.

Furthermore, the user can use references to the following Fields to access information of the current entities' parent Group:

* `currentRepetitionOfParent`: the repetition index of the current entities' parent Group.
* `repetitionsOfParent`: the repetitions value of the current entities' parent Group.
* `parentName`: the name of the current entities' parent Group.
* `parentPath`: the path of the current entities' parent Group.

Table 4. Simple Examples of Preconditions using Additional Computation Fields


| Preconditions with Additional Field | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `[depth] == 1` | Returns `True` for each child of the Document Model’s root Group |
| `FieldFilled(relativeAnnotation/annotationA)` | Returns in `True` if the current entity has the annotation annotationA |

Table 5. Simple Examples of Operations using Additional Computation Fields


| Operations with Additional Field | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `[value]` | Returns the value of the current Field. |
| `[relativeMetadata/label]` | Returns the Label of the current entity. |

Table 6. Advanced Examples of Preconditions using Additional Computation Fields


| Precondition with Additional Fields | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `[parentPath] == "/general/phone/" AND [repetitionsOfParent] < 2` | Returns `True` for every child of the Group /general/phone/ if the Group has less than 2 instances. |
| `[repetitionsOfParent] > 1 AND RoundDown ([currentRepetitionOfParent] / 2, 0) != RoundUp([currentRepetitionOfParent] / 2, 0)` | Returns `True` for every 2nd child of a repeatable Group. |

#### Property Computation

A Property Computation consists of a target Property, and a set of Computation Alternatives that each consist of a Precondition and an Operation.
A wide range of Properties can be set as the target Property including:

* [Text Properties](#TextProperties)
* [Border Properties](#BorderProperties)
* [Text Styles](#TextStylesTab)

In addition, the following properties may be set:

* **Vertical Alignment:** Defines the vertical alignment of the cells content.
* **Hide Cell:** A boolean value, that if set to *True*, hides the cell completely.
* **Hide Value:** A boolean value, that if set to *True*, hides the value of the cell. (Only available for Property Computations in [Listing Columns](#ListingColumn))
* **Column Span:** A numeric value, that defines the number of columns that the cell spans. (Only available or Property Computations in [Listing Columns](#ListingColumn))

The [Additional Computational Fields](#ListingAdditionalFields) may also be used in the Preconditions and Operations of Property Computations.

#### Group Property Computation

A Group Property Computation applies properties to all Listing rows that correspond to a selected Group instance.
It consists of a target Property, a Group instance, and a set of Computation Alternatives that each consist of a Precondition and an Operation.

At the moment, only **Hide Group** can be used as the target Property for Group Property Computations.
If the Computation Alternatives evaluate to *True*, all rows belonging to the selected Group instance are hidden.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The precondition is only allowed to evaluate to true for fields and groups within the selected group path. |

##### Hide Group Example

The following example demonstrates how to hide a repeating `addresses` group based on a condition.

![Hide Group Property Computation detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_listing_hide_group_detail_view.png)

Figure 47. Hide Group Property Computation detail view

Example: Hiding an repeatable address group when it is marked as not public

* **Group Path:** `/customer/addresses`
* **Precondition:** `[path] == [metadata/customer/addresses/isPublic/path] And [value] == False`
* **Operation:** `True`

In this example, all rows belonging to the `addresses` group will be hidden when the `isPublic` field’s value is `False`. The following images show the rendered PDF output:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Result without condition  Figure 48. All Groups visible | Result with condition  Figure 49. Non Public Groups hidden |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can use the `path` metadata field in computations to reference an element’s path as a string value. For example, `[metadata/customer/addresses/isPublic/path]` resolves to `"/customer/addresses/isPublic/"`. |

#### Attachments

Attachments in the Listing element are included in the generated PDF if the selected group contains attachment groups. These attachments are added at the end of the PDF, after all Print Model content has been rendered. Each attachment starts on a new page.

##### Rendering of Attachments

Attachments can be resolved in two ways:

* **Embedded Attachment**: The content of the attachment is embedded in the document data.
* **Referenced Attachment**: To reference an attachment by setting the attachment ID. The AttachmentProvider will use this ID to provide the attachment content at render time

###### Rendering behavior:

* If the attachment content is present, it will be rendered.
* If the attachment ID is present, the referenced attachment will be rendered.
* If both content and ID are specified, the content takes precedence and will be rendered.

To allow referenced attachments, you need to use the [AttachmentProvider](https://geta12.com/docs/PRINT_ENGINE/print-technical-documentation/index.html#attachment_provider).

* **Attachment Fields**: In the rendered listing, all attachment fields are displayed, but the content field will be shown as a link referencing the rendered attachment.
* **Image Size**: The image size is scaled to fully fit the page’s width.
* **Supported Attachment Types**:

  + Images: `png`, `jpg`
  + PDFs: `pdf`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * If the attachment type is not supported, the content field is not shown in the listing result, and the attachment is not rendered. * The rendering of attachments may differ when using [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode). |

### Table Layout

The Table Layout element inserts a static table into the resulting PDF document, which provides a static layout to its contents.

**Accessibility Hint**

This element is currently not recommended, if the resulting PDF document should conform to accessibility standards,
as it will be considered as table, even if it is used differently in your modelling.

Instead you should arange text elements manually in the Editor Stage.

Number of Rows
:   The number of rows in the resulting table.

Number of Columns
:   The number of columns in the resulting table.

Row Properties
:   Index
    :   Number in the range from 1 to the defined number of rows>> that identifies the row targeted by this set of properties.

    Minimal Row Height
    :   Defines the minimal height of a row in millimeters.
        If unset, the default of 10mm is used.
        See [Input Source](#InputSource) for more details.

Column Properties
:   Index
    :   Number in the range from 1 to the defined number of columns that identifies the row targeted by this set of properties.

    Column Width
    :   Defines the width of a column in percentage relative to the width of the Table Layout Element.

    Vertical Alignment
    :   Defines the Vertical Alignment of a columns contents.
        Possible Values are:

        * Top
        * Middle
        * Bottom

The Table Layout element is configurable using [Border Properties](#BorderProperties).

Figure 50. Table layout element detail view

#### Table Layout Cells

After modeling the Rows and Columns in the Table Layout, Print Model Elements can be added, edited and deleted in each cell by hovering over the desired cell in the Table Layout in the Editor Stage.

To add an element click the "+" button in an empty cell. Clicking the "+" button brings up a popup that allows to select an element type to be added.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Currently, the only supported type is the [Text](#Text) element. |

To edit an existing cell element, hover over the desired cell in the Table Layout and click the "Edit" button.

Removing the content of a cell is done by hovering the cell and clicking the "Delete" button.

### Charts

The Chart elements insert a chart representation of repeatable A12 field instances into the resulting PDF document.
The chart will be generated as an image and inserted into the PDF document.

**Accessibility Hint**

This element is currently not recommended, as the Chart element does not generate a meaningful description of its content for accessibility software like screen readers.

If you have this requirement in your project, please reach out to Print Engine team.

Charts have the following common modeling settings:

Height
:   The height of the Chart Element in centimeters. One decimal place may be used, for example, 7.5 cm.

Width
:   The width of the Chart Element in centimeters. One decimal place may be used, for example, 7.5 cm.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The height and width of Charts can only be edited in the Page [Detail View](#DetailView). They cannot be adjusted by dragging and dropping the Element in the Editor Stage. |

Document Model
:   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

Group
:   The Diagram element requires selecting a group of a document model to read from.
    The root group is selected by default, but it’s possible to select an inner group using the model tree widget, then the resulted data set only contains the fields of the selected group.

Data
:   The Data used by the chart is specified below the Group.
    The way that the Chart Data is specified depends on the type of Chart.

| Chart | Data Type | Modeling Settings | Multiple Data Sets allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Line Chart | Series | Field with value | Yes |
| Bar Chart | Series | Field with value | Yes |
| Categorized | * Field with value * Field for labels | Yes |
| Pie Chart | Categorized | * Field with value * Field for labels | No |

#### Line Chart

Displays multiple continuous lines in a horizontal or vertical orientation, each line corresponding to a separate set of values.
These sets of values are modeled by adding one or more series data sets.

Label X-Axis
:   The X-Axis Label may be entered or set to undefined.

Label Y-Axis
:   The Y-Axis Label may be entered or set to undefined.

Orientation
:   There are two types of orientation to select from:

    * **Horizontal**: The Value will be displayed on the X Axis
    * **Vertical**: The Value will be displayed on the Y Axis

![Line Chart element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_line_chart_detail_view.png)

Figure 53. Line Chart element detail view

##### Series Data

Series Data is modeled by selecting a repeatable field.
The value of this field on the axis defined by the Orientation.
The other axis will count through the repetitions of the selected Field.

Field with value
:   Specify the Field from the selected Document Model that contains the Series Data.

Name of series
:   The name of this Series Data in the Print Model.

###### Example

The Document Model contains a repeatable Group, `Person`, with two Number Fields, `income` and `tax`.
The following Data is modeled:

Table 7. Series Data Example


| Field with value | Name of series |
| --- | --- |
| `root/Person/income` | DataSet1 |
| `root/Person/tax` | DataSet2 |

Based on the following data in the Document:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` Person[0]:   income: 10   tax: 1  Person[1]:   income: 20   tax: 4  Person[2]:   income: 15   tax: 6 ``` |
```

The result will be two Datasets:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` DataSet1: [10,20,15] DataSet2: [1,4,6] ``` |
```

#### Bar Chart

Displays multiple sets of bars in a horizontal or vertical orientation, each set of bars corresponding to a separate set of values.

Label X-Axis
:   The X-Axis Label may be entered or set to undefined.

Label Y-Axis
:   The Y-Axis Label may be entered or set to undefined.

Orientation
:   There are two types of orientation to select from:

    * **Horizontal**: The Value will be displayed on the X Axis
    * **Vertical**: The Value will be displayed on the Y Axis

Bar Charts accept [Series Data](#SeriesData) and [Categorized Data](#CategorizedData).
To model Series Data, simply leave the "Field for labels" blank.

![Bar Chart element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_bar_chart_detail_view.png)

Figure 54. Bar Chart element detail view

##### Categorized Data

The Category DataSet is created based on two Fields from the Document Model so that each value has a label.

Field with value
:   Specify the Field from the selected Document Model that contains category values.

Field for labels
:   Select the label Field which is used for the categorization process.

The result is a Dataset which includes each unique Field for labels value.
The Field with value data will be created by summing up the value fields with matching labels.

###### Example

The Document Model contains a repeatable Group, `Person`, with a Number Field, `income` and a String Field `occupation`.
The following Data is modeled:

Table 8. Categorized Data Example


| Field with value | Field for labels |
| --- | --- |
| `root/Person/income` | `root/Person/occupation` |

Based on the following data in the Document:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` Person[0]:   occupation: "A"   income: 1  Person[1]:   occupation: "A"   income: 2  Person[2]:  occupation: "B"  income: 1 ``` |
```

The Dataset consists of two data points, one for each unique value of `occupation`.
The Value of the datapoint is the Sum of all the Field Values with this label:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` A : 3 B : 1 ``` |
```

#### Pie Chart

Displays a pie distribution chart based on a single set of [Categorized Data](#CategorizedData).

Use numeration as label
:   Select "Use numeration as label" If the data shouldn’t be grouped.
    Each Value will be represented by its own with a unique incrementing
    number being its label.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | "Field for labels" may be left blank when "Use numeration as label" is selected. |

![Pie Chart element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_pie_chart_detail_view.png)

Figure 55. Pie Chart element detail view

### Bounding Box

The Bounding Box element provides the ability to group elements in a specific region.
The Bounding Box functions analog to the Area, except that it does not grow with its contents and provides no option to set a data context.

The properties of the Bounding Box element are determined by its [Border Properties](#BorderProperties).

To access the [Bounding Box Stage View](#BoundingBoxStage), hover over the Bounding Box and click the revealed "Edit" button in the top right-hand corner of the Bounding Box.

#### Bounding Box Stage View

The Bounding Box Stage View functions similar to the [Editor Stage](#EditorStage).

The main difference between these Editor Stage Views are:

* The Bounding Box Stage View has the dimensions of the corresponding Bounding Box.
* The Bounding Box Stage View displays the borders of the corresponding Bounding Box.

Elements inside a Bounding Box are positioned in relation to the Bounding Boxes upper left corner.

Leave the Bounding Box Stage View by clicking on the desired level in the Breadcrumb navigation displayed in the top left-hand corner.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * The positioning of the Elements inside a Bounding Box is unaffected of the Bounding Box border. Therefore, the Elements and the Bounding Box border may overlap. * The height calculation and positioning of the Elements inside the Bounding Box are done independently of Elements outside the Bounding Box. |

![Bounding Box Stage View](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_boundingBox_EditorStage.png)

Figure 56. Bounding Box Stage View

### Area

The Area element provides the ability to group elements in a specific region.
Once created, the Area content can be edited on a separate Area stage.

Layout calculations of the Area content are done separately to the elements outside the Area.
This way, the Area with its content interacts exactly as one single element.
If the Area content grows outside the Area, the Area grows to fit its content.

Repeatability Settings
:   Document Model
    :   Select a Document Model referenced in the [Schema Tab](#SchemaTab).

    Group
    :   A Group can be selected as a data context in the Area configuration.
        If the selected group is repeatable, then the Area will be repeated for each instance of the repeatable group in the provided A12 Document.

The Area element is also configurable using [Border Properties](#BorderProperties).

![Area element detail view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_area_detail_view.png)

Figure 57. Area element detail view

To access the [Area Stage View](#AreaStage), hover over the Area and click the revealed "Edit" button in the top right-hand corner of the Area.

#### Area Stage View

The Area Stage functions similar to the [Editor Stage](#EditorStage).

The main difference between these Editor Stage Views are:

* The Area Stage has the dimensions of the corresponding Area
* The Area Stage displays the borders of the corresponding Area
* At the lower border of the Area Stage, an extension point is accessible, which can be dragged to define the [Overflow Height](#AreaOverflowHeight) of the Area.

Elements inside an Area are positioned in relation to the Areas upper left corner.

Leave the Area Stage View by clicking on the desired level in the Breadcrumb navigation displayed in the top left-hand corner.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * The positioning of the Elements inside an Area is unaffected of the Area border. Therefore, the Elements and the Area border may overlap. * The height calculation and positioning of the Elements inside the Area are done independently of Elements outside the Area. |

![Area Stage View](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_area_EditorStage.png)

Figure 58. Area Stage View

##### Overflow Height

The height of the [Area Stage](#AreaStage) can be increased by the definition of an Overflow Height.
Drag-and-drop the lower border of the Area to edit the Overflow Height.
The Overflow Height allows the user to place additional Elements inside the Area.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This works well in combination with the usage of [Hide Conditions](#HideConditions). |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The distance between the lowest Element inside the Area to its lower bounds will stay always the same. |

### Switch

The Switch element is a container element similar to [Area](#Area) and [BoundingBox](#BoundingBox). It provides the ability to group elements in a specific region.

This is an advanced container that dynamically controls the visibility of enclosed [Area](#Area) elements based on specified preconditions.

To access the [Switch Cases](#SwitchCases), hover over the Area and click the revealed "Edit" button in the top right-hand corner of the Area.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is not allowed to set [Border Properties](#BorderProperties) on the Switch and a DataContext on the [Area](#Area) Case. |

![Switch element properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter03/03_switch_properties.png)

Figure 59. Switch element properties

#### Switch Cases

Preconditions and associated [Area](#Area) Elements are added by clicking on "Add".
These preconditions are written as [Computations](#Computations) in the [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) syntax.

Leave the Switch Cases View by clicking on the desired level in the Breadcrumb navigation displayed in the top left-hand corner.

Precondition
:   When a precondition evaluates to *True*, the corresponding Area element becomes visible as the same Switch position.

    If the precondition evaluates to *False*, the Area element is hidden.

    If all preconditions evaluate to *False*, the Switch is hidden as well.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | It is possible that there are multiple cases visible at the same time. |

Elements

## print-shell

This chapter covers the print-shell. This is a command line interface which allows to use some handy tools of the Print Engine.

### Prerequisites

print-shell is available in the artifactory.

To run the print-shell, Java 21 must be installed and available from the command line.

### Start print-shell

The print-shell must be started in the command line with the command:

```
java -jar print-shell-[PrintEngineVersion].jar
```

The print-shell is a handy tool, that allows you to use the following commands:

#### Migration

Until Print Model version `2.1.0` the migration is done by the print-shell command line interface.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Since with release 2.1.0 we introduce a new typescript based migration tool to align with overall A12 standards. The print-shell migration will no longer validate and pretty print starting from version 3.0.0. To ensure the same output as prior versions, you need to run the print-shell migration and then the typescript migration in order to migrate to the latest version. In releases after 2.1.0, only the typescript migration will be relevant. |

```
migrate -w workspacePath -o overwrite
```

* `workspacePath`: Path to the workspace containing the Print Models.
* `overwrite`: `true` if you want your Print Models to be overwritten by the migrated models, `false` otherwise.

#### Comparison of Two PDF-Documents.

```
compare -1 pdf1 -2 pdf2 -p percent
```

* `pdf1`: Name of the first PDF-document
* `pdf2`: Name of the second PDF-document
* `percent`: The percent of the allowing pixels to be different for comparison. Valid values range from 0 to 100. The default value is 0

#### Comparison of All PDF-Documents With the Same Name.

```
compare-all -w workspacePath -p percent --equal equal
```

* `workspacePath`: Path to the workspace containing the PDF-documents.
* `percent`: The percent of the allowing pixels to be different for comparison. Valid values range from 0 to 100. The default value is 0
* `equal`: This defines how the matched PDF files are found. By default the command is checking for `startWith`. If this parameter is set to true the file name of the PDF files need to be completely equal.

#### Printing a Specific Print Model.

```
print -w workspacePath -p printModelId -d documentId -t timeZone --locale localeString --useExperimentalRendering useExperimentalRendering --suffix suffix
```

* `workspacePath`: Path to the workspace containing the Print Models.
* `printModelId`: ID of the Print Model used for the print operation.
* `documentId`: ID of the A12 Document used for the print operation.
  Example: For document file `DomainDocument-1` the ID is `1`.
* `timeZone`: Timezone for the print operation.
  Example: `GMT`
* `localeString`: Locale to use for the print operation.
  Example: `de`
* `useExperimentalRendering`: This flag controls, which rendering pipeline is used. It is set to false by default, which means that [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) will be used. For the default rendering mode, set it to be true. With the deprecation of the Legacy Rendering Mode in the 2026.06 release, this flag will be removed.
* `suffix`: The suffix is attached separated with a '-' on the final PDF file name

#### Printing All Print Models in the Current Workspace.

```
print-all -w workspacePath -t timeZone --locale localeString --useExperimentalRendering useExperimentalRendering --suffix suffix --filter filter
```

* `workspacePath`: Path to the workspace containing the Print Models.
* `timeZone`: Timezone for the print operation.
  Example: `GMT`
* `localeString`: Locale to use for the print operation.
  Example: `de`
* `useExperimentalRendering`: This flag controls, which rendering pipeline is used. It is set to false by default, which means that [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) will be used. For the default rendering mode, set it to be true. With the deprecation of the Legacy Rendering Mode in the 2026.06 release, this flag will be removed.
* `suffix`: The suffix is attached separated with a '-' on the final PDF file name
* `filter`: With the filter option it is possible to define a Regex to print only Print Models with IDs that match. If empty, all Print models in the workspace are printed.

## Print Setting

This chapter instructs how to customize the configuration of Print Engine.

### Setting Model Configuration

The Print Engine has its own Print Setting Model that allows you to adjust Print Engine settings. At present, it supports adjustments to font settings only.

You can create a new Print Setting Model in the SME workspace and edit it by selecting it. Each workspace allows only one Print Setting Model.

![The Setting Editor](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter05/05_setting_editor_modal.png)

Figure 61. The Setting Editor

#### Roles

The roles table allows you to define the allowed roles for the Print Setting Model.

You can select roles from the workspace by clicking the btn:[Add] and selecting
an option from the dropdown. Roles can be deleted by clicking the red button in the row
and confirming your choice.

#### Fonts Settings

The Font Settings allow you to define custom fonts and adjust the fallback font.

##### Customize Fonts

To add a new custom font, click the btn:[Add] button in the Customs section. A new custom font row will be added, where you can enter the `font name` and define the `font value` to include the font file.

The font file can be specified as either a file path or an attachment:

* **Path:** Enter a valid relative path to a font file within your SME workspace, e.g. '/folder/font1.ttf'. Note that font files outside the workspace cannot be used. If needed, copy the font files into your workspace
* **Attachment:** Select the font file using the file dialog. The font will then be attached directly to your Print Settings model.

To switch between these types, click the quick access button next to the `font value` input. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the `font value` type:

![The font value dropdown](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter05/05_font_value_dropdown.png)

Figure 62. The font value dropdown

**Accessibility Hint**

In order to ensure accessibility compliance, it is important to select fonts that support all necessary characters for the languages and text used in your documents.

Avoid ornate or decorative fonts. Opt for sans-serif or simple serif fonts with clearly distinguishable characters (for example, the characters ‘I’, ‘l’, and ‘1’ look very similar in some fonts).

Use regular or bold weights of a font family. Thin fonts can be hard to perceive, especially for low vision users.

Choose fonts that work well with high contrast: Some fonts lose clarity if foreground/background contrast is strong; test your choices.

There are also several technical requirements for fonts in the PDF/UA standard (see the Matterhorn Protocol (<https://pdfa.org/resource/the-matterhorn-protocol/>) for more details). You can test a font in a PDF via the PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC) and PDFaPilot.

##### Allowed Font Extensions for Custom Fonts

The only fully supported font file format is `ttf` (TrueType fonts).

##### Available Default Fonts

The Print Engine comes with three available default fonts:

* Open Sans
* Noto Sans Mono
* Open Sans Symbols

##### Font Support for DIN 91379

DIN 91379 is a standard that ensures all relevant characters for European languages are correctly displayed.

The default font *'Noto Sans Mono'* included in the Print Engine supports all DIN 91379 characters. If this font does not match the desired style, you can define your own custom font in the print settings that also supports all characters.

##### Overwrite default fonts

Within the Defaults section, you will find a list of default fonts supported by the Print Engine. These default font settings cannot be modified directly but can be overwritten.

To overwrite a default font, define a custom font with the same name as the default font you wish to overwrite. The default font name will be displayed with a strikethrough. Text using the default font will then be displayed in your custom font.

![Overwrite default fonts](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter05/05_overwrite_default_font.png)

Figure 63. Overwrite default fonts

##### Setting fallback fonts

The fallback font is utilized when a specific font is unavailable. The default fallback font is Open Sans from the default font set. All custom fonts will be available for selection as fallback options.

![Fallback font](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter05/05_fallback_font.png)

## Typesetting

This chapter instructs how to customize the typesetting of text within the Print Engine and is intended for modelers
familiar with Print Modeling.
Typesetting controls the composition and flow of text when a document is printed.

Typesetting is not availabe in the [Legacy Rendering Mode](#legacy_rendering_mode) of the Print Engine.

### Typesetting Model Configuration

The Print Engine has a dedicated Typesetting Model that allows you to add customizable rules to the setting of your text.

![Typesetting Editor](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/TypeSetting_EditorScreenshot.png)

Figure 65. Typesetting Editor

You can create a new Typesetting Model in the SME workspace and edit it by selecting it.
You can create, edit, and reference multiple Typesetting Models per workspace.

To affect your text, follow these steps:

1. Create, edit, and save a Typesetting Model.
2. Reference the Typesetting Model in the [Schema tab](#SchemaTab) of your Print Model.

   ![Referencing Typesetting Model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_ReferenceModel.png)

   Figure 66. Referencing Typesetting Model
3. Create a Text Style and [reference](#TypographySettings) the Typesetting Model.

   ![Text Style with Typesetting Model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_TextStyleReference.png)

   Figure 67. Text Style with Typesetting Model
4. You can now apply the custom Text Style that you created to your Print Model Elements.

#### Prevent Line Break Rule Settings

These settings allow you to define exceptions to hyphenation and line wrapping when text is printed with the Print Engine.

##### Character Sequence Rules

This option allows you to define specific words or character sequences that should not be hyphenated.

To add a new character sequence, click the btn:[Add] button. A new row will be added to a table, where you can enter the desired sequence.
Do note that only hyphens (-) and alphabetical characters are allowed. Other characters like numbers will prompt an error message and
prevent you from saving the model.

To remove a rule press the button on the right of the row and confirm your choice in the dialog.

![Character Sequence Rules](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_CharacterSequence.png)

Figure 68. Character Sequence Rules

##### Number Unit Rules

This option allows you to define character strings that will be treated as units of measurement.
They will not be line wrapped if preceded by a number, which means the number and unit will stay together on the same line.

To add a new unit rule, click the btn:[Add] button. A new row will be added into a table, where you can enter the desired unit.

To remove a rule press the button on the right of the row and confirm your choice in the dialog.

![Number Unit Rules](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_NumberUnitRule.png)

Figure 69. Number Unit Rules

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | While Number Unit Rules allow usage of a wide selection of possible symbols, they may not be supported by the font of the selected Text Style. In this case the Print Model can not be printed and will show an error in the print preview. |

##### Special Pattern Rules

This option allows you to apply a set of curated rules that were designed for special use cases.
Currently, there are two special patterns available:

* §{digit} Abs. {digit} - e.g. §3 Abs. 7 for referencing german legal texts
* {digit}({digit})({letter}) - e.g. 219(1)(a) for referring to document sections

If you require different special patterns that cannot be covered by any of the preceding options, please contact the Print Engine Team to implement a new Special Pattern Rule.

![Special Pattern Rules](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_SpecialPatternRule.png)

Figure 70. Special Pattern Rules

#### Orphan and Widow Settings

In typesetting, "orphan" and "widow" are terms that define how text at the start or end of a page is treated in regard to the visual flow of the text.
Proper management of widows and orphans results in professional-looking documents and prevents isolated lines from disrupting the reader’s flow.
As definitions vary, the Typesetting Model defines them as follows:

* Widows: How many isolated lines are allowed at the start of a page (Default: 2)
* Orphans: How many isolated lines are allowed at the end of a page (Default: 2)

These settings allow the modeler to define their custom limits for Orphans and Widows for their texts.

![Widow and Orphan Settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/assets/chapter06/Typesetting_OrphanWidowSetting.png)

#### Roles

The roles table allows you to define the allowed roles for the Typesetting Model.

You can select roles from the workspace by clicking the btn:[Add] and selecting
an option from the dropdown. Roles can be deleted by clicking the red button in the row
and confirming your choice.
