# Document Modeling

This documentation is intended for a business analyst audience.

## Introduction and Concepts

The Document Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor (SME) and enables domain experts and analysts to create and modify domain-specific Document Models for business applications. Document Models support the definition of complex Validation and Computation Rules using the Kernel Language.

The core idea of mgm A12 is to encapsulate domain-specific knowledge in models. The Document Model Editor is used to create Document Models containing fields and computation and Validation Rules. A model typically aggregates all field and rule definitions that are needed for a particular domain of an application. The Document Model Editor is complemented by other editors in the Simple Model Editor which are used to create models of user interface elements such as forms and overviews for the domain.
The strict separation of data modeling and UI modeling is a core principle of the A12 architecture. It leads to a high level of flexibility during the UI creation process and promotes the re-usability of models. For example, you can create several different user interfaces based on a single Document Model.

Rules are defined in their own domain-specific language, the Kernel Language, which is specifically designed for applications with complex forms. All fields must be defined on predefined field types (text, number, date, and others). In addition to the default field types, custom Type Definitions can be specified. Any Document Model that has been created with the Document Model Editor can be persisted in the file system as a **JSON file**.

The core of the editor is a hierarchical view of data fields and Validation and Computation Rules: the DM Model Tree. The screenshot shown in [Figure 1](#fig:data-modeler-grid) provides a first impression of the user interface. The details will be gradually explained in the subsequent chapters.

![data modeler grid](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/data-modeler-grid.png)

Figure 1. The DM Model Tree

### Document Model

A Document Model is based on a defined set of fields. It includes Validation and Computation Rules which are specified using the Kernel Language.

A Document Model consists of three parts:

1. A set of model settings, also called *Header*,
   which are defined as part of the model configuration
2. A set of fields and rules, ordered hierarchically by using groups
3. A set of reusable Type Definitions (optional)

### Model Settings

The Document Model Editor defines a list of locales as a model setting that influences the model behavior in several different ways.

#### Multilingual Models

A12 supports multilingual applications by allowing the declaration of the locales needed for a Document Model in its Header part (see [Locales](#txt:reference:languages)).

Applications using this model or artifacts generated from this model can then choose which locale to display to the user. This is often used for error messages (see [Error Message](#txt:reference:error-message)), field labels, enumeration values, or descriptions (see [Descriptions](#txt:reference:descriptions)).

### Model Elements

The following sections will give a brief introduction of the elements of Document Models that can be used to create a Document Model and the Validation Rules on top of it.

#### Fields

Fields represent controls in an application form that may have quite different appearances. A field can either be an input field for different data types or output text as well as a drop-down box from which a value can be chosen.

The standard field types are

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Date
* Date Time
* Time
* Date Fragment
* Date Range
* Enumeration
* Confirm
* Custom

All field types support multi-linguality: For each locale, an internal description (being displayed in the Form Model Editor), an external description (being displayed as a hint in the UI) and a label can be defined.

For more details about fields and field types refer to [Field Editor](#txt:reference:general-field-properties).

#### Type Definitions

In addition to the field types, A12 supports the creation of your own reusable *Type Definitions*. They are project specific "templates" of field data types that can be reused for multiple fields or can be shared across Document Models. They are described in detail in [Type Definitions](#txt:reference:type-definitions).

In the Document Model Editor, the available Type Definitions are displayed in a separate menu entry.

![type definition view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/type-definition/type-definition-view.png)

Figure 2. The Type Definition menu

#### Groups

Groups are used to structure your Document Model in a logical or functional way. Groups can be nested and represent a multilevel parent-child-structure. Groups can also have a multilingual internal and external description.

Groups are the only element type that can have child elements.

As a special attribute, groups can be marked as "repeatable". This way they can handle multiple instances of their child elements (for example, multiple addresses for a person’s contact data).

See also [Groups](#txt:reference:groups).

#### Validation and Computation Rules

A Validation Rule is a condition that refers to one or more fields in the model. Rules are used to restrict field values or to put them in a specified relation. They can also be used to define computations where the result of a calculation rule can be bound to a specific field. Some common scenarios are:

* The value of field *A* must not be empty.
* The value of field *A* must be in a certain range or match a specific pattern.
* If field *A* is not empty, the value of field *B* must fulfil certain criteria.
* Both fields *A* and *B* must either be empty or not empty.
* The value of field *A* must be equal to the sum of the values of field *B* and field *C*.
* The result of adding the values of the fields *A* and *B* should be shown in field *C*.

Due to the power of the Kernel Language the Document Model can be defined on a very fine level (for example, much more detailed compared to XML Schema).

Rules also support the use of multiple locales. For more details about Validation Rules refer to the reference [Validation Rules](#txt:reference:rules) and the separate [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html).

Rules can also be used to perform calculations. This is described in detail in chapter 6 (*Calculation in A12*) of the *Kernel Language Guide*.

### Composition of Models with Includes

Apart from fields, groups, and rules the Document Model Editor also allows the specification of so called *include* elements at any location of the model hierarchy, even at the top level.

An include is a specification of another (sub) model at a specific location of a (parent) model that is interpreted as an inclusion of all Type Definitions, fields, groups, rules, and computations of the (sub) model. Thus, an include offers the possibility to reuse existing configurations of fields, groups, rules, computations, and Type Definitions for different models without copying. Changes to the original (sub)model will also become effective in the included (sub)models, which cannot be changed directly within the (main)model which is using the include. An example is shown in [Figure 3](#fig:include:include): Here, the included model is `Addresses_DM`, however, its content is contained in a group called `Addresses`.

![include](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/include/include.png)

Figure 3. An Included Model

Included models can again use includes to reuse other models which in the end allows hierarchies of models and also promotes modularity. The usage of includes is described in [Includes](#txt:reference:includes).

However, there are some constraints on the use of includes:

* A model cannot include itself directly or indirectly.
* Included models are read only. That is, they cannot be altered in the editor from within the parent model. It is only possible to view the properties of the included elements.
* Included models can only contain a single top-level group. This includes attachments which are also groups.
* The top-level group of included models must not be repeatable. This excludes multi-selects from being used as top-level group.
* The top-level group of included models must not be empty.

The include element is interpreted at runtime while only referencing the included model file at specification time. That is why changes to the included model will always lead to changes of the including model. The final interpretation of these includes happens in the Document Model Editor for the modeler as well as the underlying generator which generates the validation data. See also section [Copy Includes](#txt:reference:copy-includes).

### Model Consistency Constraints

There are several constraints on how Document Models can be put together. Most of them are very specific and will not be discussed here as the editor will display error messages to warn about problems.

However, there are some very basic constraints that should be kept in mind when working with models:

* The top level of a model only allows groups, include elements, attachments and multi-selects.
* All elements within a group or on the top level of the model must have different names, e.g. two sibling fields or fields and rules in a common parent group may not have the same name. However, the same element name can be used across different groups within the same model.

### Type Definition Model

A *Type Definition Model* is a Document Model which contains no groups, fields and rules but only Type Definitions. Find more information on how to create and use Type Definition Models in [Imported Type Definitions](#txt:reference:imported-type-definitions).

### Model Compatibility and Expert Mode

The so called *expert mode* flags Kernel features that can be handled by A12 but are not available in the modeling tools.
It is not recommended to use any of those features, as they are maintained for compatibility reasons only.
The following expert mode features are supported for Document Model field types:

* *String*

  + no value validation
* *Number*

  + min/max length
  + maxIntegerDigits
  + positivesOnly
* *Date*

  + partially known dates allowed
  + check that the date should be after 1900
* *Date range*

  + interpretation of year

## Installation

The Document Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor. For advice on the installation of the Simple Model Editor, refer to the "Quick Start Guide" on getA12 under "Modeling".

### Migrating Existing Models to a New Version of the Tools

It might be necessary to migrate existing Document Models in case a new version of the Simple Model Editor and thus Document Model Editor has been installed.

In most cases, the Simple Model Editor can handle updating versions itself. For more information, refer to the documentation of the Simple Model Editor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that the version number of the migration tool for Document Models is related to the *Kernel* version integrated into the Simple Model Editor/Document Model Editor and not to the Document Model Editor or SME version itself. The associated *Kernel* and Document Model versions can be seen on the A12 release page and in the Model Versions Info of SME. |

## Basic Editor Functions

### Open the Document Model Editor

To access the Document Model Editor, open a Workspace in the Simple Model Editor (SME). If existing models should be edited or viewed, they need to be in the opened Workspace. After opening a Workspace, all models that are contained in it are displayed in the Workspace Explorer of the Simple Model Editor. Document Models will be recognized as such by the Simple Model Editor, and the respective icon "D" will be displayed next to them.

![workspace explorer](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/workspace_explorer.png)

Figure 4. Workspace Explorer Containing Document Models, Among Others

For more information on Workspaces in the Simple Model Editor, refer to the SME documentation.

To open the Document Model Editor for an existing model, click on the model name in the Workspace Explorer.

To create a new Document Model, use the "Add" button in the header of the Workspace Explorer and select "Document Model".

![add document model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/add-document-model.png)

Figure 5. Add a New Document Model

A modal will then be displayed to define the most important model settings: target folder, model name, locale, and roles.

![add document model modal](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/add-document-model-modal.png)

Figure 6. Enter Initial Model Settings for New Document Model

The model name must be unique in the Workspace.

It is important that the folder selected is actually the target folder for this model. The location is required to correctly set the path for [includes](#txt:reference:includes), so changing the folder later might cause issues if includes are used.

At least one locale must be entered. Note that only locale codes according to ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 are allowed. It is possible to add a region code after an underline, such as en\_US, de\_DE, de\_CH, and so on.

The roles that you can assign to your model are taken from a YAML file in the Workspace. If you have created your Workspace using the Preview App Control, this file is in the "user" folder and is called "access-rights.yaml". If no valid YAML file is visible to the Simple Model Editor, then the drop-down will be blank and the assignment of roles is optional.

### Sidebar

In the sidebar of the Document Model Editor, the name of the Document Model is displayed in the top. The following perspectives can be accessed:

* Model Tree
* Settings
* Type Definitions
* Rule Contradictions

Below the menus, the following buttons are available:

* Deploy
* Cancel
* Save As
* Save

The menus as well as saving a model will be described in the subsequent chapters.

### Model Tree

The *Model Tree* is the central editor component for the design of Document Models. Here, elements such as groups, fields and rules can be added, edited, deleted and viewed.

![model tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/model-tree.png)

Figure 7. Model Tree and Field Editor of the Document Modeling Module

Since the elements are displayed in a tree, each element represents a *node* in the tree. An action that acts on an element is thus a *node action*. Some nodes can contain other elements, such as group nodes. When a node contains other elements, it becomes a *parent node*, and all elements contained in it are its *child nodes*.

All model elements are placed below a *virtual Model Tree node*. The row actions of the virtual Model Tree node allow to add and paste elements on root level of the model. The virtual Model Tree node will not be saved to the Document Model file.

![select root element](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/select-root-element.png)

Figure 8. Select a Root Element to Add

Different nodes are displayed using different icons in the Model Tree:

* Groups have a folder icon and their name is displayed in bold font
* Fields are represented by squared icons; two different types are distinguished:

  + Fields that are not computed are represented by an "F" icon
  + If a field is a computed field, it is instead represented by a "+ -" icon
* Rules are represented by diamond-shaped icons; four different types are distinguished:

  + Validation Rules of the level "error" are represented by a "V" icon
  + Validation Rules of the level "warning" are represented by a "W" icon
  + Validation Rules of the level "info" are represented by a "i" icon
  + Computation Rules are represented by a "+ -" icon

![model tree icons](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/model-tree-icons.png)

Figure 9. Icons Used in the Model Tree

#### Element Editors

To open a node in the tree, click on it using the left mouse button. Then, its corresponding Element Editor (the Field Editor for a field node, the Group Editor for a group node and so on) is opened on the right. See [Editors for Model Elements](#txt:editor:detail-dialogs) for more documentation on the different Element Editors.

In the bottom right of each Element Editor, buttons to apply the changes to the element ("APPLY") or discard the changes to the element ("CANCEL") are displayed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Be aware that "APPLY" only applies the changes to the respective element. It will not trigger saving the entire model! To save the model, use the "SAVE" button in the Sidebar. |

#### Actions

Actions in the Model Tree can mainly be found in the context menu of the respective element nodes which can be accessed via the three dot icon in each row.

![context menu](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/context-menu.png)

Figure 10. Context Menu Containing Node Actions for a Group

In the subheader, multi-select actions are available which can be toggled by the multi-select button (see [Multi-Selection and Bulk Operations](#txt:multi-selection)).

![subheader root actions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/subheader-root-actions.png)

| navigate to first and second tab, respectively | Alt + 1, Alt + 2 | Ctrl + 1, Ctrl + 2 |
| undo and redo changes, respectively | Ctrl + Z, Ctrl + Y | Cmd + Z, Cmd + Y |

##### Expand and Collapse

Single nodes such as groups, multi-selects and attachments, can be expanded and collapsed via the arrow icon left of the element name.

It is possible to expand or collapse all elements of the model via the virtual Model Tree node.

In addition, it is possible to expand or collapse all elements inside a specific node via the node actions "Expand All" and "Collapse All" in the node’s context menu.

##### Add an Element

When adding an element to the Model Tree, it needs to be distinguished between elements on root level and elements that are added as children of an existing group.
On root level, only groups, attachments, multi-selects and includes can be added. All other elements can only be children of an existing group. To add an element on root level, use the context menu of the virtual Model Tree node.

![select root element](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/select-root-element.png)

Figure 12. Select a Root Element to Add

To add an element as child of an existing group, use the group’s context menu. There, you find separate node actions to add each possible element. Adding an element is only available as node action of groups, not of fields.

Alternatively, elements can be added below existing elements. Use the context menu of the target element and choose the element type inside the sub context "Add sibling". If a Validation or Computation Rule is added below a Field, the error/computed field of the new Rule is prefilled with the target Field.

##### Copy and Paste

Copying a single node is possible via its context menu. There are a number of things to consider when copying elements:

* Copy & Paste of group nodes will also copy all of the child elements of the group
* Copy & Paste of elements inside their original parent group (or on the top level) will result in renaming as they cannot have the same names as the original elements. The copied elements will have a `_COPY` suffix appended
* Renaming also applies when elements are copied into a group that already contains elements with the same names
* It is possible to copy several elements at once by doing a multi-selection before copying
* Copy & Paste of single rules can quickly result in errors. The fields that the rule refers to in its Rule Condition must be reachable from the position of the copied rule
* Copy & Paste of includes will only copy the include, there is currently no option to copy the content of the include.

The paste action is only active if the target, be it the root action or a node action, is a valid target for the copied content. For example, it is not possible to paste a field node onto the root level, thus the "PASTE" button in the subheader will not become active. If a group node has been copied, the "PASTE" button in the subheader will become active.

##### Cut and Paste

Cut and Paste works in similar fashion as Copy and Paste. When the "Cut" action is used instead of the "Copy" action, the selected element(s) will be moved to the target destination instead of a copy of the selected element(s) being created.

##### Insert From DM

With this action, it is possible to insert a copy of all elements of another Document Model as children of the respective group node or on root level when using the action in the virtual Model Tree node. The group structure of the original model will be preserved. All includes of the source Document Model will be resolved when inserting.

##### Delete

Deleting a node is possible via its context menu.

On an attempt to delete a field that is used as an error field in one or more Validation Rules, a confirmation dialog enables choosing between deleting only the field and deleting the field as well as the Validation Rule(s) for this field.

Similarly, an attempt to delete a computed field triggers the display of a confirmation dialog that enables choosing between deleting only the field and deleting the field as well as the Computation Rule(s) for this field.

##### Multi-Selection and Bulk Operations

To toggle the multi-selection mode of the Model Tree, use the toggle button in the subheader.

![toggle multi select](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/toggle-multi-select.png)

Figure 13. Use This Button to Switch Between Single and Multi-Selection Mode

In the multi-selection mode, an additional column will appear as left-most column in the Model Tree. It contains checkboxes to select single nodes as well as a checkbox to select all elements in the column header.

Selecting an element that contains child elements such as groups always selects all children as well. It is possible to de-select single children of a selected parent node. Then, the state of the checkbox will switch from "selected" (checkmark) to "indeterminate" (square).

![multi selection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/multi-selection.png)

Figure 14. Multi-Selection in the Model Tree

As soon as at least one node has been selected in the Model Tree, the bulk operations become active, while all non-bulk operations become inactive. The only exception to this is the paste action on root level as well as on node level.

As bulk operations, copy, cut, delete, and [Ad Hoc Testing](#txt:adhoc_testing) are available.

Using the toggle button again will hide the multi-selection column. If nodes are selected, a confirmation modal will appear, since hiding the multi-selection column will lose the multi-selection as well.

##### Ad Hoc Testing

*Ad Hoc Testing* is a feature of the Document Model Editor that creates and shows a preview form containing form elements for a set of selected Document Model elements. This is especially helpful for early experiments regarding proper validation of the selected elements.

It can be triggered in two ways:

* As bulk operation, by clicking the lightbulb icon in the bulk operation bar after performing a multi-selection
* As operation on a single model element, by clicking the lightbulb icon in the context menu of the Model Tree entry

In the latter case, the Ad Hoc Testing of groups, includes, and multi-selects incorporates all model elements these contain.

If a rule is selected for Ad Hoc Testing, all Document Model elements that the rule relies upon are automatically included in the preview form. With a bulk operation it is possible to test multiple rules and computations at once.

When Ad Hoc Testing is triggered for a single field, only the validation of the Data Type, Data Type Configuration and Required (if Parent Group is Filled = no) are activated.
If further validation should be activated in the preview form, the corresponding rule(s) must be selected with a bulk operation.
Consequently, if a user manually selects several fields but not the rules that should be tested, their validation is not applied in the preview form.

As a best practice, select only the rules that should be tested and not the model elements that the rule relies upon.

Additionally, ad hoc testing provides automatic synchronization, allowing the user to modify selected elements, renaming them, updating Type Definitions or field types.
This ensures a harmonious and uninterrupted user experience, since the user does not have to reload the preview window to see
the changes their actions caused.

![adhoc testing](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/adhoc-testing.png)

Figure 15. Ad Hoc Testing of a Multi-Selection of Document Model Elements

The Ad Hoc Testing for the multi-selection of elements as depicted in [Figure 14](#fig:editor:multi-selection) opens the preview depicted in [Figure 15](#fig:editor:adhoc-testing). The validation is triggered by clicking the checkmark icon in the sidebar menu.

##### Move

Elements like fields and groups can be moved from one group to another by dragging selected elements and dropping them on the target group.

Multiple elements can be moved if they are selected via the multi-selection.

When moving a field that is used in at least one validation or Computation Rule, the SME displays a dialog with the option to perform a refactoring operation that renames the field references in these rules. Similarly, when moving a rule, a dialog offers the option to adapt the paths of field references in this rule according to its new location.

#### New Model

In a new Document Model, the Model Tree is initially empty and an "ADD" button is displayed.

#### Search and Filter

In the header of the Model Tree, it is possible to filter the Model Tree for element types and search for elements.

![search filter](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/search-filter.png)

Figure 16. Filter and Full Text Search

### Search Settings

Elements can be searched by either their `name` (default), `label` or `ID`. This can be configured by clicking on the settings icon and choosing another option.

![search settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/search-settings.png)

Figure 17. Search settings

### Filter Settings

To toggle the display of fields, Validation Rules and Computation Rules, use the filter button. A pop-up will be displayed to restrict the display of fields, Validation Rules and Computation Rules in the Model Tree.

![filter for elements](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/filter-for-elements.png)

Figure 18. Filter for Model Elements

Initially, all elements are displayed. De-select element types to filter the Model Tree. An indicator on the filter icon will show if the view is currently filtered.

To search for elements by their name, use the search field. Only elements which (partially) match the input will be displayed. To reset the view, clear the search field.

The reset button next to the filter button will reset the view by removing any filter for elements and any search.

### Settings

In the Settings menu, model-wide settings can be made.

![model properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model/model-properties.png)

Figure 19. The *Model Configuration* Dialog

#### Model Name

The Document Model name of the Document Model. The Document Model name needs to fulfill certain conventions: Only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores and periods are allowed. Furthermore, the name of the model must not start with "xml" and must be at most 100 characters long.

The model name must be unique in the Workspace and it must match its filename.

#### Configuration

##### Supported Characters

It is possible to maintain character sets for the documents of a Document Model. A character set is basically a set of (unicode)-characters, which are allowed to be used inside String fields. If users attempt to save a document that uses a String value in a String field that contains a character which is not in the character set, a formal error is reported.
This does not only hold for fields that are directly of type String, but also restricts fields whose type evaluates to a String, such as fields that have a custom Type Definition as data type and enumeration values. Furthermore, it also applies to fields whose value is computed.
Character sets should not be confused with encoding. Encoding is the way the text is encoded, not the set of allowed characters.

By default, no supported characters are set explicitly and Document Models assume [Unicode-Plane-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)) as character set.

To indicate supported characters that deviate from the default, the allowed characters can be entered by editing the *Supported Characters* field. Within the modal the supported character set can be specified and will be imported.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | During import, the character set is simplified as follows:  * Areas and individual characters whose Unicode code points (e.g. “0x0043”) are adjacent to or overlap other areas or individual characters are merged. * All duplicates are removed from the combined characters. * The result is the list of all sorted ranges and individual characters, followed by the sorted combined characters. * Sorting is in ascending order by Unicode code point value. Combined characters are also sorted in ascending order by string length. |

Each allowed character has to be enclosed by quotation marks and allowed characters must be separated by commas. In its entirety, the content describes a character array in JSON format. The input has to be surrounded by square brackets, such that it yields an input like this:

```
[ "\n", "\r", " ", "!", "\"", "#", "$", "%", "&", "'", "(", ")", "*", "+", ",", "-", "a", "ß", ... ].
```

Within the brackets, there are the following options for defining the character set:

* Individual characters, e.g. `[ "a", "b", "c", …​​ ]`.
* Ranges of single characters, e.g. `[ "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9", …​]`. The ranges can also be defined using the corresponding Unicode code points, e.g. `[ "\u0061-\u007A", "\u0041-\u005A", "\u0030-\u0039", …​]`.
* Combined characters that consist of a maximum of three individual characters, e.g. `[ "C̆", "C̨̆", …​​ ]`.
* Concatenated combined characters in which a maximum of three individual characters occur in total, e.g. `[ "K͟H", "K͟h", "k͟h", …​​` ].

It can be used to define a character set that conforms to the DIN 91379 standard.

If one or more characters are indicated explicitly in the supported characters field, the default is overridden, that is, only the characters indicated explicitly are allowed and all other characters are forbidden.
Note that it is only possible to allow characters of Unicode-Plane-0. Other characters, such as emojis, cannot be added.

The content of a valid input for the standard character set is as follows:

```
["\n", "\r", " ", "!", "\"", "#", "$", "%", "&", "'", "(", ")", "*", "+", ",", "-", ".", "\/", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", ":", ";", "<", "=", ">", "?", "@", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z", "[", "\\", "]", "^", "_", "`", "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z", "{", "|", "}", "~", "¡", "¢", "£", "¥", "§", "©", "ª", "«", "¬", "®", "¯", "°", "±", "²", "³", "µ", "¶", "·", "¹", "º", "»", "¿", "À", "Á", "Â", "Ã", "Ä", "Å", "Æ", "Ç", "È", "É", "Ê", "Ë", "Ì", "Í", "Î", "Ï", "Ð", "Ñ", "Ò", "Ó", "Ô", "Õ", "Ö", "×", "Ø", "Ù", "Ú", "Û", "Ü", "Ý", "Þ", "ß", "à", "á", "â", "ã", "ä", "å", "æ", "ç", "è", "é", "ê", "ë", "ì", "í", "î", "ï", "ð", "ñ", "ò", "ó", "ô", "õ", "ö", "÷", "ø", "ù", "ú", "û", "ü", "ý", "þ", "ÿ", "Œ", "œ", "Š", "š", "Ÿ", "Ž", "ž", "€"]
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The String data used in Document Metadata will be validated to ensure that the characters used are included in the *Supported Characters* defined in the Document Model.  Modeling a restricted set of *Supported Characters* can lead to formal validation errors when adding or updating the Document Metadata which prevent the Document from being saved. |

#### Locales

This field stores a list of locales for the model. Each locale is represented by a row in the table.

At least one locale must be entered. Note that only locale codes according to ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 are allowed. It is possible to add a region code after an underline, such as de\_DE, de\_CH and so on.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you want to test your models in the **Preview App**, model the locales `en` and `de`.  Note that locales like `de` and `de_DE` (or `en` and `en_US`) are formally different locales. `de` is not treated as a fallback for `de_DE` (and `en` is not a fallback for `en_US`). |

The editor will show a separate input field for every given country code where multilingual inputs are possible, for example for error messages, labels, and descriptions.

If a locale is deleted from the Document Model by deleting its row from the locale table, a warning will be shown mentioning that all texts that have been set up for that locale will also be deleted.

For more information about locales see [Multilingual Models](#txt:intro:languages).

#### Labels

These fields store a list of labels for the model, one for each specified locale.

The labels can be used as a localizable representation of the model itself in a list of different models. For example, in a model repository. The label of the Document Model will also be used in the variant selection modal for example when using the A12 feature "Heterogeneity".

#### Annotations

An Annotation is a name-value pair that can be added to the model in the model settings and all model elements. The application that uses the Document Model can access those Annotations and can use them within custom implementation, for example, to show all fields that have an Annotation in boldface.

In the model settings, at least one Annotation is set which contains the roles for this model.

#### Roles

Roles can be indicated in the Document Model when it is created. Afterwards, the roles can be inspected in, added to, and removed from the list of available roles in the Settings menu.

#### Expert Mode

##### Time Zone

The time zone is used for date, date time and time fields to correctly display their respective values in the UI. Currently, time zones "UTC" and "Europe/Berlin" are available. For new Document Models it is set automatically to "UTC". If a Workspace contains Document Models with differing time zones, the models which use time zone "UTC" will be marked as invalid.

### Type Definitions

In the Type Definitions menu, Type Definitions can be viewed, added, edited and deleted. Type definitions can either be defined in the edited model or be introduced via an include or import. Only Type Definitions that have been defined in the edited model can be edited or deleted.

For information on what *Type Definitions* are and how they work, refer to the [Type Definitions](#txt:reference:type-definitions).

### Undo and Redo Changes

It is possible to undo or redo changes in the Model Tree as well as in an Element Editor, the Model Settings and the Type Definitions Overview and Editor. Undo/redo buttons are displayed in the top right corner of the overviews/editors.

![undo redo](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/undo-redo.png)

Figure 20. Undo/Redo Buttons in Model Tree and Field Editor

It is possible to use the shortcuts Ctrl+Z for undo and Ctrl+Y for redo.

There are two levels of changes that can be undone separately:

#### Changes in the Model Tree, Model Settings, and Type Definitions Overview

Changes in the Model Tree include:

* changes to an element done in its editor (this summarizes all individual changes in the Element Editor into one change in the Model Tree).
* reordering/moving of elements.
* adding/deleting elements.

Changes in the Model Settings include:

* all changes to fields.
* adding/deleting rows.

Changes in the Type Definitions overview include:

* changes to a Type Definition done in its editor (this summarizes all individual changes in the Type Definition Editor into one change in the Type Definition overview).
* adding/deleting a Type Definition.
* adding/removing an import of a Type Definition Model.

Changes in the Model Tree, Model Settings and Type Definition overview can be undone/redone on the same level, that is, if a change is made to the Model Tree and then to the Model Settings, an undo action will first revert the change to the Model Settings, a second will lead the view back to the Model Tree and a third one will undo the change to the Model Tree.

The element’s icon will wobble as visual feedback to the modeler if a change is being undone/redone to an element.

#### Changes in the Element Editors and Type Definition Editor

The Element Editors and Type Definition Editor will be considered separately when it comes to undo and redo. While an Element Editor or the Type Definition Editor are open, the undo/redo buttons will be inactive in the Model Tree or Type Definition overview, respectively.

All changes done in an Editor can be undone/redone. Once an Editor is closed via Cancel or Apply, there is no possibility to undo/redo anymore.

### Refactoring Support

The Document Model Editor supports automatic refactoring for both within-model and cross-model references.
When you rename, move, or delete elements that are referenced elsewhere, the tool identifies affected references and presents options for updating them.

For general information about the refactoring feature, workflow, and actions, see the [Refactoring Support](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-ba-docs/index.html#refactoring_support) documentation.

For detailed information specific to Document Model refactoring, including supported operations, reference types, and examples, see the [Refactoring](#dm_refactoring) chapter.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Within-model refactoring is an experimental feature that can be enabled or disabled in the SME Tool Settings. See [Enabling Within-Model Refactoring](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-ba-docs/index.html#enabling_refactoring) for configuration instructions. |

## Editors for Model Elements

This chapter describes all of the various Element Editors for the different model elements that can be edited in the Document Model Editor.

### Field Editor

A field is a single element of data in a Document Model. The field can be used to store user input or have a fixed value, for example.

Fields have a data type that determines what kind of values can be assigned to them. Depending on the data type also a *Data Type Configuration* can be defined which can put restrictions on the values allowed to be entered. Data Type Configurations may also extend the field or provide additional formal aspects related to formatting.

Fields also have a few general properties which are independent of the data type. Those general properties are shown in the top of the Field Editor (see [Figure 21](#fig:general-field-properties)). The properties specific to a data type can be set below.

![general field properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/general-field-properties.png)

Figure 21. Properties Common to All Field Types

#### Name

The name of the element.

Constraints: Names always must start with a letter and may not contain any whitespace or special characters except for underscores. They must not start with "xml". Siblings and rules within the same group must have different names. Furthermore, the length is limited to 200 characters.

#### ID

IDs are auto-generated by the Document Model Editor and thus are *read only*.

#### Path

The path of the field in the Document Model is displayed.

#### Data Type

The *Data Type* property determines the data type of the field. There
are twelve options to choose from:

* String
* Number
* Date
* Date Time
* Time
* Date Fragment
* Date Range
* Confirm
* Boolean
* Custom
* Enumeration
* Type Definition

Those will be explained in the following sections in more detail.

#### Required

The Required property declares whether or not a Field is mandatory. If a document is validated without a value given for a mandatory Field Instance, an error will be returned. The setting "Only if Parent Group is filled" may be used in combination with the Required property to modify the conditions when a field is mandatory. In addition, repeatability is a further condition:

A Field is repeatable if it is within a repeatable Group - either as a direct child or nested within other subgroups. For this repeatable Field there will be Field Instances according to the created repetitions (see also [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#Custom_attributep)). These Repetitions might either be created by the user or by setting Initial Rows in the corresponding Form Model.

If "Only if Parent Group is filled" is set to false (default setting), all Field Instances are mandatory. Therefore:

* A field with a repeatability of 1 is mandatory and must be filled.
* A field with a repeatability greater than 1 is mandatory each time an instance of this field is present.

If "Only if Parent Group is filled" is set to true, only those Field Instances are mandatory, which are in a Parent Group that contains data. This is given, whenever the Kernel Language construct "GroupFilled(RuleGroup)" evaluates to true for a Validation Rule in the same Parent Group. With this said, the property extends the semantics of "FieldNotFilled(Field)" to "GroupFilled(RuleGroup) and FieldNotFilled(Field)".

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To test this property, at least one field in the parent group must be selected along with the field in the Ad Hoc Test. |

If "Use Default Error Messages" is selected, a localized text like "This field is required." will be shown. Customized texts per Field can be given, if "Use Default Error Messages" is deselected.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The default message can be changed via the localization API. |

Required Fields are decorated with a symbol according to their settings:

![required model tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/required-model-tree.png)

Figure 22. Only if Parent Group is Filled is Set to False

![required model tree group](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/required-model-tree-group.png)

Figure 23. Only if Parent Group is Filled is Set to True

#### Global

The property *Global* works as a tag and identifies fields of fundamental relevance.
In case of a partial validation, all global fields of a model are added to the set of relevant fields (see also [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#relevantfields)).
This property can be selected via a checkbox.

#### Transient

If the *Transient* property is selected, the field will not be
persisted. This can for example be used for interim results of a
complex calculation. It can be selected via a checkbox.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | By default, Data Services will not persist fields marked with the respective property. This can be changed via configuration. |

#### Label

This property can be used as a default field label in a user interface. It can be entered for each language that has been set up for the model (see [Multilingual Models](#txt:intro:languages) and [Locales](#txt:reference:languages)).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The contents of this field will be displayed read-only in the *Document Model Label (Multilingual)* field within the *Edit Control* dialog of the Form Model in the Form Model Editor as well as in the Overview Model Editor. Unless another label is defined in those Editors, this label will be used by the respective engine. |

#### Descriptions

There are two types of descriptions: internal and external description. Both of them can be defined individually for each language for which the model has been set up.

![descriptions field editor](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/descriptions-field-editor.png)

Figure 24. Descriptions in the Field Editor

* **Description (Internal)**: These descriptions are used for technical documentation purposes, for example as a technical description of a field or Validation Rule. The contents of this field will be displayed read-only in the *Internal Field Description (Document Model)* field within the *Edit Control* dialog of Form Models referring to this Document Model.
* **Description (External)**: The external description is a way to add a hint to this field in the UI. More information on hints on different levels and their display in the UI can be found in the [Form Modeling Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-fm-ba-docs/index.html).
* **Helper Text**: A helper text is shown below the input of this field in the UI. Helper texts cannot be defined for Confirm data types or Type Definitions.

#### Annotations

An Annotation is a name-value pair that can be added to the model in the model settings and all model elements. The application that uses the Document Model can access those Annotations and can use them within custom implementation, for example, to show all fields that have an Annotation in boldface.

Annotations can be maintained in each Element Editor. An "A" icon is displayed behind an element’s name in the Model Tree if it contains Annotations.

### String Fields

Strings are field types that can contain arbitrary text which might be limited by setting up regular expressions. The data type configuration for string fields is shown in [Figure 25](#fig:string-properties).

![string properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/string-properties.png)

Figure 25. String Data Type Configuration

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The option "Trailing/Leading Blanks Permitted" does not exist anymore. |

As part of the *DataType Configuration* string fields can be restricted by:

Min. Length
:   The minimum number of characters of the text. This must be a valid integer number.

Max. Length
:   The maximum number of characters of the text. This must be a valid integer number.

Pattern
:   A user-defined regular expression in Java/Perl syntax that restricts possible values of this field in documents. For example, the pattern `[a-zA-Z]+` only allows strings that have at least one letter, either in lowercase or in uppercase, while other characters are not allowed. The character limit for regular expressions is 1000 characters. For some more details on that syntax, refer to the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#WieMusterundNichtWieMuster).

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | When using the pattern property, additionally an error message has to be entered which will be displayed in case the rules defined for the pattern are violated. |

There is a built-in check if the input in the field "Pattern" results in a valid regular expression.

Line Breaks Permitted
:   To enable multi-line input. Defaults to single-line input.

Alphabetical Sorting
:   To enable the alphabetical sorting of the localized texts during runtime.
    It only makes sense to enable this option for a string field, if the field is used in an enumerable context (for example, external enumerations).

Suggestions
:   This property provides end users with multiple suggestions (hint list) for data entry into a string field. The user can either choose from the predefined string values of the suggestions or add a custom value. The values of the suggestions are maintained as localized and are validated against other field restrictions, such as defined patterns. The resulting document does not distinguish whether the value is from the hint list or a user-defined entry.

![string suggestions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/string-suggestions.png)

Figure 26. String Data Type Configuration with Suggestions

Figure 27. List of Suggestions Maintained per Locale

### Number Fields

The data type configuration for number fields is shown in the [Figure 28](#fig:field-types:number-properties).

![number properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/number-properties.png)

Figure 28. Number Data Type Configuration

The number field type is suitable for all data fields that might be involved in arithmetic calculations or comparisons.

It should not be used for fields that can only contain digits but are not used for calculations, such as postal codes or numeric identifiers.

The following restrictions can be set for number fields:

Decimal Places
:   Defines the number of decimal places allowed. If less than the maximum number of decimal places are entered, the remaining decimal places will be padded with zeroes in the Form Engine. There are three options:

    * `NONE` (no decimal places) - no subfields displayed.
    * `FIXED` (fixed number of decimal places) - when choosing that option, the subfield *Decimal Places* will be displayed for setting the number of decimal places. When entering a value with less than the fixed number of decimal places into a number field with a fixed number of decimal places, the remaining decimal places will be filled with zeros.
    * `RANGE` (a range with minimum and maximum number of decimal places) -for that option the subfields *Min. Decimal Places* and *Max. DecimalPlaces* are displayed to allow to specify the minimum and maximum number of decimal places. When entering a value with less than the minimum number of decimal places into a number field with a range of decimal places, the minimum number of decimal places will be filled with zeros.

Zero Not Allowed
:   To disallow zero values for the field. In case a zero value is entered, an error message will be displayed (*Invalid Value: The provided value must not be equal to 0*).

Leading Zeros Allowed
:   This setting will allow to enter leading zeros in a number field.

Min. Value
:   The minimum value of the user input. This may be a floating-point number if decimal places were defined.

Max. Value
:   The maximum value of the user input. This may be a floating-point number if decimal places were defined.

Unit
:   This option can be used to give the field a special meaning, such as *Amount* for monetary values or *Percent* and *Permille*. It does have an effect on the data type configuration options, and only 0 or 2 decimal places are allowed when choosing the amount unit. Other than that, the validation of the field is not changed, except for different default error messages for amount number fields.

### Date Fields

The A12 Document Model supports the definition of dates: [Figure 29](#fig:date-properties) depicts the dialog for setting the data type configuration of date fields. No further configuration options are available for this data type.

![date properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/date-properties.png)

Figure 29. Date Data Type Configuration

![date picker](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/date-picker.png)

Figure 30. Date Picker in the Preview Mode

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that the dates will be stored within the documents always in the YYYY-MM-DD format, for example `2023-05-28`. When selecting a date using the date picker, the date format for displaying the date depends on the localization selected. For example, for the English/United States localization it would be shown as `05/28/2023` whereas for the German/Germany localization `28.05.2023` would be displayed. |

### Date Time Fields

In addition to the use of date fields the Document Model Editor supports the definition of date time. The data type does not have further configuration options (similar to Date and Boolean).

![date time properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/date-time-properties.png)

Figure 31. Date Time Data Type Configuration

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that in A12 internally the ISO standard format for date, time and date time will be allowed. |

### Time Fields

There is also the option to define a field with the data type time within Document Model Editor. In this case no further configuration options are available for this data type, it therefore corresponds to the options of the Date or Boolean type.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Refer to the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#Date_attributep) for further information about the validation of the data types Date, DateTime and Time. |

### Date Fragment

The date fragment data type is intended to use for date specifications that are not known or needed as a complete date. Four different formats can be specified:

* MM
* YYYY
* YYYY-MM
* MM-DD

![date fragment properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/date-fragment-properties.png)

Figure 32. Date Fragment Data Type Configuration

### Date Range

Date ranges can be specified using five different formats:

* YYYY/YYYY
* YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD
* MM/MM
* YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM
* MM-DD/MM-DD

![date range properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/date-range-properties.png)

Figure 33. Date Range Data Type Configuration

### Confirm Fields

A Confirm field is either *True* or not set (*null*).

No further configuration options are available for this data type.

![confirm properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/confirm-properties.png)

Figure 34. Confirm Data Type Configuration

### Boolean Fields

The Boolean field type can contain *True* or *False* as value or is not set (*null*).

No further configuration options are available for this data type.

![boolean properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/boolean-properties.png)

Figure 35. Boolean Data Type Configuration

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If a Boolean is required it can be *True* or *False*, so either is a valid value, but if a Confirm type is required the only valid value is *True*. |

### Custom Fields

Custom fields are a way to define special fields with project-specific validation logic, that cannot be adequately expressed using regular expressions. The Kernel provides the implementations for some Custom Field Types. For information on how to create your own Custom Field Type refer to the [Kernel Developer Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-dev/index.html).

The data type configuration for custom fields is shown in [Figure 36](#fig:custom-properties).

![custom properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/custom-properties.png)

Figure 36. Custom Data Type Configuration

For custom fields the following configuration options are available:

Name
:   The name of the Custom Field Type to be used.

Min. Length
:   The minimum number of characters.

Max. Length
:   The maximum number of characters.

### Enumeration Fields

Enumeration fields can be used for selecting values out of a predefined set of alternatives. In [Figure 37](#fig:enumeration-properties) the dialog for setting the data type configuration for enumeration fields can be seen.

![enumeration properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/enumeration-properties.png)

Figure 37. Enumeration Data Type Configuration

Enumeration fields offer a list of predefined values for the user to choose from. Such fields will usually be presented in the form of drop-down lists or radio buttons. In the column *Value* of the Enumeration properties the value which will be stored for the different selections is defined. In the other columns the value displayed in the user interface can be set for each language the model is set up for.

Alphabetical Sorting
:   If the property is set to true the list of enumeration values will be sorted by their localized text in the UI.

#### Enumeration Values

The declaration of an enumeration field type requires at least two statements for each enumeration value:

* **Value** This property defines the value of the selection as it will be stored in the Document Model. No blanks are allowed here.
* **Text (multilingual)** This property defines the label of the selection option for the graphical user interface. This property is multilingual and thus can (and should!) be defined for every language configured for the model.
* Furthermore, there is one column for each defined **Category**. The category values can be written directly in the cell. In addition a Drop-Down Selection is available, which contains all already inserted enumeration values for this category. For each enumeration value a category value has to be set. If this is not the case, then an error message will be shown when trying to apply the changes.

To add new enumeration values, use the *ADD* button underneath the enumeration value table. This will add an empty line at the bottom of the table. The position of the entries can be changed via the arrow buttons in each row.

![enumeration table gaps](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/enumeration-table-gaps.png)

Figure 38. Gaps in Enumeration Values

When creating enumeration values, it may occur that there are gaps in the labels of values. In the enumeration value table, such gaps are denoted by the cell value `- empty -`. All rows that have a gap in one of their values are annotated with an error icon on the left side. The 'Fill Empty Texts' button above the table can be used to auto-fill all gaps with the corresponding enumeration value. For example, assume that the enumeration value `Postal` has the English label `Postal address` and an empty German label. After pressing the "Fill Empty Texts" button, the German label of this enumeration value will be set to `Postal`.

Empty labels for locales are only allowed if **none** of them are filled. The default behavior at runtime of A12 is to use the enumeration value for any locale with empty texts.

It is possible to remove entries via the delete button in each row. All entries can be removed at once with the 'Clear Values' button above the enumeration value table.

#### Error Message

An error message is displayed when the user selects an invalid enumeration value. Invalid enumeration values may occur due to customizations by the application or by modifying the value with the keyboard.

The error message can be defined in the section below the enumeration value table (see [Figure 39](#fig:enumeration-properties-error)). As a standard feature, default error messages are used. Alternatively, the checkbox *Use Default Error Message* can be unchecked. Then, custom error messages can be specified for each of the languages the model supports. The error message property is mandatory and must be entered for every language defined for the model.

![enumeration properties error](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/enumeration-properties-error.png)

Figure 39. Enumeration Data Type Configuration - Error Messages

#### Enumeration Categories

Categories for an enumeration can be used to define a grouping for the enumeration values. In a rule, enumeration keys can be queried by their category. Refer to the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#Enumeration_attributep) for detailed information.

Categories can be defined in the table above the enumeration value table. For each category a unique name has to be provided. Furthermore, an optional description can be set. For each available category a column will be shown in the enumeration value table. Each enumeration value requires one value per category.

Add a new category to the table via the *ADD* button underneath the category table. Delete a category via the delete button in each row.

### Type Definition Fields

Type Definition fields are applied for reusable custom enumerations and restrictions. Setting up Type Definitions is described in [Type Definitions](#txt:reference:type-definitions). The usage of already existing Type Definitions is shown in [Figure 40](#fig:type-definition-field-properties).
If the "Type Definition" checkbox is selected, a drop-down is displayed next to it and the field "Data Type" becomes read-only. If a selection has been made in the drop-down, the data type of the field is set to the Type Definition’s data type.

![type definition field properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/field-types/type-definition-field-properties.png)

Figure 40. Type Definition Data Type Configuration

The Type Definition is actually not a field type itself. It rather is a reference to a predefined definition of a field type that can be reused for the field under consideration. For more details refer to section [Type Definitions](#txt:reference:type-definitions).

The Field Editor offers the list of Type Definitions that were defined for the current model within the *Type Definition* view or introduced via including another Document Model or importing a Type Definition Model. The name of Type Definitions which have been defined in another model consists of the origin model name, an underscore and the name of the Type Definition in the original model.

A "TD" icon is displayed next to a field’s name in the Model Tree if it is a Type Definition field.

![typedef model tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/typedef-model-tree.png)

Figure 41. A Type Definition field in the Model Tree

### Groups

The very first element of each Document Model must be a so called top-level group. Without at least one top-level group no fields can be created.

Groups are used for hierarchically organizing the Document Models; they are mainly used to structure the Document Model and combine their child elements (fields, rules, and other groups) into groups of elements. Every group must have a name and an ID. The ID is auto-generated and read-only. The name of a group is limited to 60 characters and must be unique among sibling groups.

[Labels](#txt:reference:label), internal and external [descriptions](#txt:reference:descriptions), and [Annotations](#txt:reference:annotations) can be set in the same way as they can for Field Editors.

#### Repeatability and Index Field

The *Repeatability* property sets the maximum amount of instances that are allowed to be created for the group. The maximum number of repeatability is 999,999. For repeatable groups the *Index Field* can be used to identify a concrete repetition. Such an *Index Field* is always a mandatory field and is marked with a `#` icon in the Model Tree. The two following rules are generated automatically for it:

* check that the field is mandatory for the group with `(GroupFilled(RuleGroup) and FieldNotFilled(indexField))`
* check that the values are unique within the repeatable group `RepetitionNotUnique(indexField)`

![indexfield model tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/indexfield-model-tree.png)

Figure 42. An Index Field in the Model Tree

The definition of an *Index Field* allows the usage of the Validation features *Semantic Index* and *Parallel Iteration*, refer to the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#wiederholbarkeitp) for detailed information. An example for setting up the properties of a group can be seen in [Figure 43](#fig:group-dialog).

When an instance of the model is filled with data, the group together with its child elements may be repeated as many times as the repeatability property for the group states.

![group dialog](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/group-dialog.png)

Figure 43. Configuration of Group Elements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is also possible to define an *Index Field* for a non-repeatable group. |

### Validation Rules

Validation Rules are used to define constraints on the Document Model.

The most important property for Validation Rules is the rule condition. This condition puts one or more fields in relation with each other and can also include constants to impose restrictions for values of specific fields.

It is very important to notice that conditions specify the case in which the rule is triggered and *not* valid behavior.
For example:

* There are two fields *A* and *B*. Field *B* should be mandatory when *A* is filled.
* The correct rule condition would be: *FieldFilled(A) and FieldNotFilled(B)*, because it is an error if field *A* is filled and field *B* is not.

Besides the general information (name and ID), the internal and external description (for each language in multilingual models) and the possibility to add Annotations, there are some more properties that can be defined for rules. These are described in the following sections.

The Validation Rule Editor consists of two tabs. In the first tab "Basic Data", information is given around the Validation Rule. The Validation Rule needs a unique name.

![validation rule editor basic data](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/validation-rule-editor-basic-data.png)

Figure 44. The Validation Rule Editor, tab Basic Data

In the second tab, "Condition", the Validation Rule properties are defined as well as the Rule Condition and resulting Error Messages for the end user.

![validation rule editor condition](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/validation-rule-editor-condition.png)

Figure 45. The Validation Rule Editor, tab Condition

In the following sections, the settings maintained in the Validation Rule Editor will be covered.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is possible to save invalid Validation Rules. This will result in an invalid model, but gives the modeler the opportunity to work on their rules in steps. |

#### Error Code

The error code property can be used as an error identifier for the application or the user. It is generated automatically but is editable.

#### Error Field

The error field is the field that will be used to display the error message if this rule reported an error during validation. The error field must be referenced in the rule condition.

There is an auto-completion mode available to help select the error field.

#### Level

There are three severity levels for Validation Rules:

* **Error**: The severity level *Error* is used to represent an invalid application/form state. Messages of this severity level are marked in red and disable saving of or navigation through the application/form until the error is eliminated.
* **Warning**: The severity level *Warning* signals a possibly unwanted application/form state. Messages of this severity level are marked in orange. Contrary to error messages, warnings do neither disable saving of nor navigation through the application/form.
* **Info**: The severity level *Info* can be used to display additional information to the user if the rule fires. Messages of this severity level are marked in blue. Similar to warning messages, info messages do neither disable saving of nor navigation through the application/form.

#### Condition

The rule condition, as explained above, contains the specification of an incorrect state in an instance of a Document Model. The condition must be specified in terms of the Kernel Language. By default, the SME supports the English Kernel Language. Models can also use the German Kernel Language, but the language must be changed in the corresponding Document Model(s) with an external tool. The rule condition can also contain calculations, for example there might be an error if the sum of two field values does not match the value of a third field.

Within this field, an auto-completion is available. This means that by entering CTRL+SPACE or the letter(s) of a field name or a Kernel Language construct, a list of available proposals will automatically be displayed. Entering additional letters will further reduce the list of proposals. Elements within that list can be chosen by selecting them (using either the arrow keys or the mouse) and then hitting ENTER. The auto-completion mode can be left by hitting the `<ESC>` key.

If the name of a field is the same as a terminal in the rule language, the Rule Condition fails. As a solution, you may surround the field name with single quotes (’). This applies for Groups, CustomConditions or Categories as well. For instance, `MinValue` is a terminal in the rule language and if it is used as a field name, the following rule condition is valid:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` FieldFilled(Group/’MinValue’) AND [Group/’MinValue’]==1 ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For computations - as well as for numerical comparisons - multiple numerical constants can be used, as for example the constants `2`, `43` and `999` in the following condition. `2 * [NumberA] + 43 <= 999` |

Rule conditions can be defined which will lead to an error if one or more fields within a group are not set (e.g.`FieldNotFilled(<Field>)`). If such a condition is defined for a **repeatable** group, an error will even occur if a validation is done on an empty group. This situation might result for example from creating a new data set for a repeatable group (using the *Add* button), entering no data, and then trying to save the complete data set that includes the repeatable group.

For more information about this domain specific language refer to the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html).

##### Additional Operator Information

When hovering with the mouse over an operator (for example FieldFilled) additional information about the operator is displayed. It also includes a link to the documentation of the operator.

![rules additional operator info](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/rules-additional-operator-info.png)

Figure 46. Additional Information is Displayed When Hovering Over an Operator

##### Additional Element Information

When hovering with the mouse over an element that is currently used in the Rule Condition editor, additional information about the element is displayed.

![rules additional info](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/rules-additional-info.png)

Figure 47. Additional Element Information is Displayed When Hovering Over an Element

##### Additional Parser Error Information

The rule condition is validated by the rule parser in the background, which may result in a reported error. Hovering the mouse over a highlighted error in a rule condition will display additional information about the error from the rule parser. It also includes a link to the rule parser error documentation.

![rules additional error info](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/rules-additional-error-info.png)

Figure 48. Additional Information is Displayed When Hovering Over a Problem

##### Allow Differing Decimal Places

Clicking the button will add the text `@SuppressWarning(MVK_INVALID_COMPARE_DEC_PLACES)` at the beginning of the condition text.
This allows the comparison of numbers with an unequal number of decimal places (fractional digits) within the rule condition statement.

By default this is flagged as an error, since the comparison of numbers and the assignment of other number field values should be restricted to only numbers with equal amount of decimal places and would lead to an error otherwise. In certain situations, this may be undesirable and ticking the box will suppress the error.

The suppression text must be deleted to return to the default behavior.

##### Format

A standard formatting of the Rule Condition is available via the button "FORMAT". The editor will introduce line breaks and spaces to increase readability of the Rule Condition.
While formatting a Rule Condition text, following changes are done:

* Unnecessary spaces are removed (for example double spaces).
* Missing spaces are added (for example, a space is always inserted after a comma in a parameter list).
* Indentation is normalized.
* Syntax of `And` and `Or` is capitalized.
* Unnecessary brackets are removed.
* Leading zeroes in numbers are removed.
* `AtLeastOneFieldFilled` and `NoFieldFilled` are replaced by `FieldFilled` and `FieldNotFilled` respectively, if only one parameter without star is defined.
* `AtLeastOneGroupFilled` and `NoGroupFilled` are replaced by `GroupFilled` and `GroupNotFilled` respectively, if only one parameter without star is defined.
* If the rule group (which can also be a root group) is referenced with its absolute path, it will be replaced during formatting by the language construct `RuleGroup` (only if no star was specified).

##### Maximize Rule Condition Editor

Via the "maximize" button above the Rule Condition Editor, the editor is maximized to take up the entire space of the SME. Leave the maximized Rule Condition Editor again via the "X" button.

#### Error Message

The error message property is used to define the content of the messages that will be displayed if the rule applies. It is mandatory to define the message text for all languages for which the model has been set up. There are some restrictions that the error message has to meet:

* The error message must not contain any line breaks.
* If you need to use the Dollar-sign, you have to put *$$* into the error message.
* The text of the error message may only contain characters from the ISO-8859-15 character set.

References to fields that are part of the rule condition can be used
within error messages. There is an autocomplete feature available to facilitate referencing fields that becomes available after typing *$*. Some aspects have to be kept in mind:

* References to field labels can be defined by embracing the field name with Dollar signs. For example *$MyFieldName$* would display its localized field label.
* A reference to the current value of a field can be defined by concatenating the field name with *.value* and putting the resulting string between Dollar signs. For example *$MyFieldName.value$* would display the value of the field *MyFieldName*.
* Only fields that are part of the condition may be referenced and the fields have to be referenced exactly like in the condition.

A reference to a specific repetition within a repeatable group is also possible using the *$#<GroupName>$*-syntax. For example if you want to check the uniqueness of the two fields *MyStringRep* and *MyNumberRep* across multiple repetitions of the group *MyRepeatableGroup*, you could reference its instances in the error message of a rule with the following text for the error message:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ```  The combination of $MyRepeatableGroup/MyStringRep$ and $MyRepeatableGroup/MyNumberRep$ has to be unique (iteration nr. $#MyRepeatableGroup$) ``` |
```

The resulting error messages shown when entering non-unique data can be seen here.

![rule error messages](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/rule-error-messages.png)

Figure 49. Validation Error Messages Displayed After Entering Non-Unique Data

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In case the text of the error message takes more space than the space provided by the width of the column in which the message will be displayed, automatic word wrapping will take place, i.e. the error message will be split across multiple lines. However, if there is a single word part of the error message which takes more space than provided by the corresponding column, there will be no line break within that word and thus the word will reach into the next column. Especially if there is also an error message displayed in that adjacent column making use of the very same line, the error messages will overlap and will be hardly readable. To avoid that misbehavior, line breaks should be added (using the dash character ’-’) to the long words manually, like e.g. in *ThisIsAVery-LongWord*. |

### Computation Rules

Computation Rules are used to check and display the result of computations.

The Computation Rule Editor consists of two tabs. In the first tab "Basic Data", information is given around the Computation Rule.

![computation rule editor basic data](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/computation-rule-editor-basic-data.png)

Figure 50. The Computation Rule Editor, Tab Basic Data

In the second tab, "Computation", the computed field is set as well as the sets of precondition and calculation.

![computation rule editor condition](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/computation-rule-editor-condition.png)

Figure 51. The Computation Rule Editor, Tab Condition

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is possible to save invalid Computation Rules. This will result in an invalid model, but gives the modeler the opportunity to work on their rules in steps. |

In the two tabs of the *Computation Rule Editor*, the following settings can be done:

* **Name**: The name of the computation which will be part of the Document Model.
* **ID** (read-only): An automatically provided unique identifier for the computation.
* **Internal and External Description**: Those are general elements which are described in [Descriptions](#txt:reference:descriptions).
* **Computed Field**: This defines the field that will be used to hold the results of the computation.

  If the computed field is repeatable the precondition must be filled and it must ensure that an instance of the parent group of the computed field exists.
* **Allow differing decimal places**: Checking this allows the comparison of numbers with an unequal number of decimal places (fractional digits) within the precondition and calculation statements or returning as computation result the value of a number field with fewer decimal places than the computed field specifies.

  By default this is flagged as an error, since the comparison of numbers and the assignment of other number field values should be restricted to only numbers with equal amount of decimal places and would lead to an error otherwise. This might be undesired in some cases and checking the box will suppress the error.
* **Common Precondition**: Computations have a list of alternatives, where each alternative is a pair of a precondition and a calculation (see below). The common precondition box can be used to specify preconditions that must be satisfied in each alternative of a computation. In order for the user to be able to edit the common precondition of a newly created rule, they
  have to select the corresponding "showCommonPrecondition" option in the editor.
* **Precondition**: Here, preconditions for the computations can be defined. There are several restrictions on them which are described in the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#_preconditions).
* **Calculation**: Here, the calculation itself can be defined which is applied if the preconditions are satisfied.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Add pairs of "Precondition" and "Calculation" via the ADD button below the table. In case of multiple preconditions, a very important constraint is that those preconditions have to be mutually exclusive.  Edit "Precondition" and "Calculation" by clicking the row or using the "Edit" button.  To delete precondition/calculation pairs, delete the rows from the table. Pairs can also be copied and reordered via the respective row actions. |

* **Format**: A standard formatting of the precondition and calculation is available via the button "FORMAT". The editor will introduce line breaks and spaces to increase readability of the conditions (refer to [Format](#txt:reference:format) for further information).
* **Maximize precondition and calculation editors**: Via the "maximize" button above the precondition and calculation editor, the editor is maximized to take up the entire space of the SME. Leave the maximized editor again via the "X" button.

Once a newly created computation has been saved, the icon of the computed field changes to indicate that this field is now a computed field (see a comparison in [Figure 52](#fig:calculations-highlighting)).

![calculations highlighting](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/calculations-highlighting.png)

Figure 52. Highlighting of Computations in the Model Grid

Rule based computations can be moved within the group hierarchy by making use of the drag-and-drop mechanism. Immediately after moving a computation, it is likely that error messages will appear because the references to the fields used in the precondition and the calculation itself might be no longer valid. In that case the field references within the computation have to be corrected using the *Computation Rule Editor*.

The details for the usage of computations are described in the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#_computation_rules).

#### Additional Element Information

When hovering with the mouse over an element that is currently used in the Precondition or Calculation, additional information about the element is displayed.

![computation rules additional info](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/computation-rules-additional-info.png)

Figure 53. Additional Element Information is Displayed When Hovering Over an Element

### Attachment

Attachment elements are used to attach files to a document via file upload to a server.

![attachment properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/attachment-properties.png)

Figure 54. The Attachment Editor

The attachment element is added to the Document Model as a group containing eight read-only fields and four read-only rules by default (see [Figure 55](#fig:attachment-element)). Elements belonging to the attachment are highlighted with a light pink background.

Fields:

* **original\_filename**: Field of data type *string* (optional)
* **internal\_filename**: Field of data type *string* (indexed, required)
* **content**: Field of data type *string* (required if *attachment\_id* is empty)
* **attachment\_id**: Field of data type *string* (required if *content* is empty)
* **size**: Field of data type *number* (required if *content* is filled)
* **mime\_type**: Field of data type *string* (required)
* **category**: Field of data type *string* (optional)
* **description**: Field of data type *string* (optional)

Rules:

* **AttachmentInternalFilenameRequired**: Rule to flag *internal\_filename* as required.
* **AttachmentMimeTypeRequired**: Rule to flag *mime\_type* as required.
* **AttachmentIdOrContentFilled**: Rule to flag either *attachment\_id* or *content* as required.
* **SizeOfContentFilled**: Rule to flag *size* as required if *content* is filled.

![attachment element](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/attachment-element.png)

Figure 55. The *Attachment* Group and its Elements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Multiple attachments for the same model attribute are not supported. Therefore, only single-select and single-upload of files is enabled. |

### Multi-Select

Multi-Select elements are used to select multiple enumeration values.

![multi select new](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/multi-select-new.png)

Figure 56. The Multi-Select Editor

The multi-select element is added to the Document Model as a group containing a single partially read-only field (see [Figure 57](#fig:multi-select-element)).
The repeatability of this group is automatically set to 999,999 and cannot be configured.
The field type may be set to Enumeration or String (for external enumerations).

![multi select element](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/multi-select-element.png)

Figure 57. The *Multi-Select* Group and its Element

This field’s name is set as **value** , but can be altered afterwards, and contains the selectable enumeration value. Here you can select whether to use an enumeration type or a Type Definition of type enumeration. In addition it is possible to set the Data Type to "String" for configuring an external enumeration.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For consistency reasons it is not possible to use imported Type Definitions or Type Definitions from includes. |

The dialog for editing the multi-select values is shown in [Figure 58](#fig:multi-select-properties).

![multi select properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/multi-select-properties.png)

Figure 58. Editing the 'Value' Enumeration of a Multi-Select

A Multi-Select element is technically implemented as a repeatable group with one field. As a consequence, it is possible to apply the same Validation Rules as for usual repeatable groups and fields.

The Multi-Select group and field can also be used in the precondition of a computation.
One exception is that the Multi-Select field cannot be a computed field itself.

### Includes

Include elements are used to insert other Document Models at a specific location of a model, potentially multiple times. The dialog for adding includes to a Document Model is shown in [Figure 59](#fig:include-properties).

![include properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/include-properties.png)

Figure 59. The *Add Include* Dialog

This allows a composition of models with emphasis on modularity. Using includes also avoids copying reusable parts of models.

Included models can be altered and all dependent models will automatically be updated with the changes of the included model during the next generation.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | An included model must contain at least the same languages as the main model, otherwise an error will be thrown. However, it is possible that the included model contains additional languages which are not used by the main model. |

Include elements are read-only. They are highlighted with a light grey background in the Model Tree. It is possible to add an Annotation to an include.

![include model tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/include-model-tree.png)

Figure 60. Display of an Include in the Model Tree

#### Document Model

Select a Document Model from the Workspace to include. When a Document Model is selected which cannot be included, an error message will be displayed. Document Models with the following properties cannot be included:

* they contain more than one root group
* the repeatability of the root group is > 1
* they do not contain all locales the currently edited model contains
* they include (nestedly) the currently edited model (no circular references)
* they have a differing Type Definition mode from the currently edited model

#### Include Repeatability

This property defines the repeatability of the group containing the content of the included model.

#### Exclude Rules

By checking these properties, the inclusion of validation and calculation rules can be skipped. Rules of the selected type in the included model (and its potential submodels) will not be included into the current model.

#### Include Name

This is the name of the group that represents the included model. The content of the included model’s single top-level group will be expanded into this group.
Thus, the name of the top-level group of an included model has no effect on the including model. It is overridden by the include name.

If rules or computations in the included model use paths through the top level group of the included model, the name of the include group in the including model must match the name of the top level group of the included model. For convenience, the Document Model Editor provides this information as a default name, which can be overwritten.

For example if a rule in the included model uses a path "..topLevelGroupName/fieldName" but the include name in the including model is "includeName" instead of "topLevelGroupName" this would lead to a consistency error in the including model.

See the [Kernel Language Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#_paths) for more information about the ".."-notation.

#### Copying Includes

The "Copy" action copies the reference to the included Document Model. To achieve that the content of another Document Model is available in an editable way, use the action [Insert from DM](#txt:insert_from_DM).

### Type Definitions

Type definitions can be used to create reusable field types: The values and restrictions defined in the data type configuration, which can get quite complex, can be reused at different places when they are defined as a Type Definition.

Examples:

* A Type Definition for lists of genders or countries (based on Enumerations with corresponding values)
* A Type Definition for Email address input fields (based on Strings, restricted by regular expressions)

Type definitions are always based on one of the standard field types (string, number, enumeration etc.) and are mainly used for the following reasons:

* They are reusable in multiple fields which is particularly useful when dealing with enumerations.
* In addition they can be used to refine the corresponding standard type for example by restricting the length or pattern of the field value.

There are two different ways to introduce Type Definitions into a Document Model: As local and included Type Definitions or imported Type Definitions.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is not possible to mix local/included and imported Type Definitions in one model. |

#### Local Type Definitions

Local Type Definitions are maintained in the model directly. If an included model contains local Type Definitions, they will also become available as included Type Definitions.

Type definitions can be added, edited, and viewed in a separate menu accessible via the sidebar (see [Figure 2](#fig:type-definition-view) and [Type Definitions](#txt:editor:type-definition-view)). Use the "ADD" button in the table header to add a new local Type Definition. Type definitions from included models are displayed with a grey background color. The column "Source" either displays "local" if the Type Definition has been maintained directly in this model, or "included", followed by the name of the model the Type Definition was defined in as well as the path and name of the include, for included Type Definitions.

As soon as a local Type Definition is present (directly or via an include), the button to import a Type Definition Model becomes disabled.

![local type definitions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/type-definition/local_type_definitions.png)

Figure 61. Local Type Definitions

Type definitions are composed of a name, a data type and its corresponding data type configuration. The data type configuration is identical to the configuration that can be done when choosing the field type for a specific field.

![type definition properties enum](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/model-elements/type-definition-properties-enum.png)

Figure 62. The Type Definition Editor

After creating a Type Definition, this new type can be chosen when selecting the type of a specific field of the model (see [Type Definition Fields](#txt:reference:type-definition-field)).

A local Type Definition can be deleted via the delete button in its row.

Included Type Definitions are read-only and cannot be deleted. They will no longer be available if the origin model is no longer included.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is no check if a Type Definition is used in a field definition before deleting it and thus no confirmation dialogue. The field definition becomes invalid if a Type Definition in use is removed. |

#### Imported Type Definitions

##### Type Definition Model

It is possible to create a Document Model which only contains Type Definitions, but no groups, fields and rules: A Type Definition Model. This offers a way to maintain all Type Definitions that are needed in the different Document Models of a project in a central place. It is possible to import Type Definition Models in a Document Model, which makes the Type Definitions available to use.

To add a Type Definition Model, use the "ADD" button in the header of the Workspace Explorer and select "Type Definition Model".

![add type definition model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/type-definition/add_type_definition_model.png)

Figure 63. Create a new Type Definition Model

After entering the basic model settings in a modal, the Type Definition Model Editor is opened. This is a variation of the Document Model Editor with the difference that there is no Model Tree to add groups, fields and rules, but only the possibility to add Type Definitions.

![type definition model editor](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/type-definition/type-definition-model-editor.png)

Figure 64. Type Definition Model Editor

Type definitions can be added directly to the model like it is described in [Local Type Definitions](#txt:reference:local-type-definitions). It is also possible to import another Type Definition Model. Type definitions which originate in a Type Definition Model that has been imported into another Type Definition Model will become available in a Document Model when importing that other Type Definition Model.

##### Import Type Definition Model

To make Type Definitions from a Type Definition Model available, the Type Definition Model has to be imported into the Document Model. To import a Type Definition Model, use the "IMPORT" button in the header of the Type Definitions table. Select the Type Definition Model that should be imported from the drop-down. As soon as a Type Definition Model has been imported, the button to add local Type Definitions is disabled.

Imported Type Definitions are displayed in the Type Definitions table. The column source mentions "imported", followed by the name of the Type Definition Model the Type Definition originates.

![imported type definitions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/type-definition/imported_type_definitions.png)

Figure 65. Imported Type Definitions

If an included model uses imported Type Definitions, they will appear in the Type Definitions table as well. The source then mentions "included imported" and the Type Definitions are displayed with a gray background.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Included imported Type Definitions are not available to use in the currently edited Document Model. To make use of imported Type Definitions, the Type Definition Model has to be imported explicitly. The included imported Type Definitions are merely displayed to explain their content since they can be used in the included Document Model. |

To remove the import of a Type Definition, use the "REMOVE IMPORT" button in the subheader of the Type Definition table. Select the model from the drop-down which you would like to remove.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is no check if a Type Definition is used in a field definition before removing the import and thus no confirmation dialogue. The field definition becomes invalid if a Type Definition Model in use is removed. Importing the Type Definition Model again results in a valid field definition again. |

### Rule Contradictions

While each rule and computation is checked for validity during editing it is possible that multiple
rules contradict each other. For instance, a rule may require that a certain field is filled and another rule may
prohibit that it is filled. To check whether a model has such
contradictions, the model editor provides the option to check for rule contradictions within the
Rule Contradictions tab.

![rule contradictions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions.PNG)

Figure 66. Viewing Rule Contradictions

When selecting the tab for the first time the report for Rule Contradictions is empty. As calculating rule
contradictions might take a while for models with many rules and fields, rule contradictions are not
calculated when changing the model. Instead, the calculation is explicitly initiated by the modeler.

To create a new rule contradiction report the "GENERATE" button in the lower right corner is used.
A modal will then be displayed that requests a value for "today". This value is preset with the current
day but can also be set to an arbitrary day to test rules that restrict only at certain time periods.

![rule contradictions generate](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-generate.PNG)

Figure 67. Modal to Generate Rule Contradiction Report

The "CANCEL" button just returns to the previously displayed report view while pressing the "CONTINUE" button
calculates a new report based on the given today value.
In case no contradictions are found, the report is empty, otherwise an overview over current rule contradictions
is shown and the number of problems is displayed in an orange circle on the tab:

![rule contradictions 2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-2.PNG)

Figure 68. Viewing Rule Contradictions

In this example two fields are reported to be unfillable. A detail view can be opened by clicking
on one of the entries in the overview. A detail view provides more insight in which rules and fields
are involved in the contradictions:

![rule contradictions details](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-details.PNG)

Figure 69. Details for a Rule Contradiction

It is possible to return to the overview using the "RETURN" button.

To solve contradictions, the involved rules need to be adapted and the report must be generated anew
as calculating the contradictions report is initiated by the modeler only. This allows the modeler to
view the old report again as well as selecting a today value before generating the report. In case the
model has changed since the report was created, a warning icon is shown on the tab.
When hovering this icon the text states that the report might be outdated.

![rule contradictions outdated](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-outdated.PNG)

Figure 70. Warning Icon is Shown if the Report is Outdated

Models with rule contradictions are not considered invalid. Thus, a model with contradictions
can be saved normally and can even be deployed.

It is possible that rule contradictions cannot be calculated. This is the case for invalid models and in rare cases
if the model contains elements that are not yet supported by the calculation.
In both cases a warning notification is shown.

![rule contradictions invalid](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-invalid.PNG)

Figure 71. Warning if Rule Contradictions Cannot be Calculated as the Model is Invalid

![rule contradictions unsupported](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/editor/rule-contradictions-unsupported.PNG)

Figure 72. Warning if Rule Contradictions Cannot be Calculated Due to Not Supported Elements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Rule Contradictions are currently not supported on MacOS. Generating the report will always state that unsupported elements were used. |

## Composed Document Model Editor

The Composed Document Model Editor is a special variant of the Document Model Editor. It is used to create and edit Composed Document Models (CDMs). CDMs are Document Models with the additional option to establish links to other Document Models via Relationship Models in their Model Tree.

### Open the CDM Editor

To add a CDM, use the "ADD" button in the header of the Workspace Explorer and select "Composed Document Model".

![open cdm editor](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/open-cdm-editor.png)

Figure 73. Create a New Composed Document Model

After entering the basic model settings in a modal, the CDM Editor is opened that contains the Model Tree on the left side. However, in contrast to the Document Model Editor, the Element Picker is displayed on the right-hand side.
The Element Picker is used to select Document Models and Relationships that should be included in the CDM.
It consists of two tabs, the Diagram and the Tree Tab.
Initially, the Diagram Tab is open. If only one diagram exists in the Workspace, it is selected automatically. If there is more than one diagram, the one suitable for the CDM creation can be selected from the drop-down menu.
In the Diagram Tab, Document Model and Relationship elements can be added to the Model Tree using diagrams that have been previously created in the Workspace.

![cdm editor initial view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/cdm-editor-initial-view.png)

Figure 74. New Composed Document Model

In the Tree Tab, Document Model and Relationship elements can be added to the Model Tree using a list of all possible Document Models and Relationships from the Workspace.

![cdm editor initial view tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/cdm-editor-initial-view-tree.png)

Figure 75. Element Picker Tree Tab

### Add Elements to the CDM

Regular Document Model elements are added in the same way as in the Document Model Editor. CDM-specific elements are added by selecting them from the Element Picker.

#### Add a Root Document Model

One of the root elements of a CDM must be a Document Model element (see [Document Model Element](#txt:document_model_element)).
In the Element Picker’s Diagram Tab, the Document Models that can be selected as the root element are marked in blue.
A click on a selectable node will add the corresponding element to the Model Tree.
In the Tree Tab, the Document Models that qualify as root elements are shown. A click on a Document Model adds it to the CDM.
The name of the added element is the name of the Document Model’s root Group. The new element is automatically selected in the tree and marked in the Element Picker.

![first node added](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/first-node-added.png)

Figure 76. CDM Editor After Selection of the Root Node

The Root Document Model can also be selected during creation of a new CDM within the add dialog.

#### Add a Relationship

The Document Model element that is selected in the Model Tree is also marked in the Element Picker Diagram Tab if the opened Model Graph Diagram contains the Document Model. To connect the selected Document Model with another Document Model, click on the respective Relationship that connects them.
The Element Picker’s Tree Tab shows all possible Relationships from the Workspace that can be connected to the selected Document Model element. A click on a Relationship adds it to the CDM.

![select relationship from tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/select-relationship-from-tree.png)

Figure 77. The Element Picker Tree Tab Shows All Possible Relationships

The respective Relationship element (see [Relationship Element](#txt:relationship_model_element)) and the connected Document Model element are added to the Model Tree. The Relationship element is added as a sibling node and the connected Document Model element as a child node of the Relationship element. The newly added Document Model element is automatically selected in the Model Tree and marked in the Model Graph Diagram.

![added relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/added-relationship.png)

Figure 78. CDM Editor After Adding a Connected Document Model Via a Relationship

#### Add a Relationship Including a Link Document Model

Adding a Relationship that has a Link Document Model works the same way as described before for a Relationship without a Link Document Model. In the Model Tree, the Link Document Model element (see [Link Document Model Element](#txt:link_document_model_element)) is added via a special Link Relationship element (see [Link Relationship element](#txt:link_relationship_model_element)) with name "relationship" below the connected Document Model element.

![add rel with linkDM](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/add-rel-with-linkDM.png)

Figure 79. CDM Editor After Adding a Relationship With a Link Document

#### Add a Self-Referencing Relationship

When a self-referencing Relationship is selected, the user is asked to select the target role. This is the role of the Relationship that is assigned to the Document Model element that will be added to the Model Tree as a child of the Relationship element.

![modal self relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/modal-self-relationship.png)

Figure 80. Role Selection for Adding a Self-Referencing Relationship

The name of the self-referencing Relationship element in the Model Tree is the name of the Relationship and the role name, separated by an underscore.

![added self relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/added-self-relationship.png)

Figure 81. CDM Editor After Adding a Self-Referencing Relationship

#### Selectable Document Models

Any Document Model that has a single Group as the only root element is selectable. The user must take care to only add 'includable' Document Models to the tree (refer to [Document Model](#txt:reference:include-document-model)).

#### Selectable Relationships

A Relationship is not selectable from a Document Model if:

* The Relationship Model is invalid and only contains one Document Model entity
* The target Document Model does not fulfill the 'selectable' requirements (see [Selectable Document Models](#txt:selectable_document_models))
* The currently selected Document Model has the same parent Relationship with the source role’s upper limit multiplicity of 1
* The currently selected Document Model already has the same Relationship as a child Relationship (sibling in the tree)

For self-referencing Relationships, the following rules apply:

* If the currently selected Document Model has the same parent Relationship with the source role’s upper limit multiplicity of 1, only the same role is selectable as source role.
* If the currently selected Document Model has the same Relationship as a child Relationship (sibling in the tree), the child Relationship’s target role is not selectable as target role.

#### Switching Between Document Model Elements

It is possible to freely select Document Model elements inside the Model Tree. Clicking on a Document Model element will select it and mark the respective node in the Model Graph Diagram as well as the selectable adjacent Relationships.

#### Switching Between Different Model Graph Diagrams

The Model Graph Diagram in the Element Picker can be changed to another Model Graph Diagram of the Workspace using the drop-down menu at the top of the Element Picker. The selected Document Model from the Model Tree and the selectable adjacent Relationships will be dynamically marked in the selected Model Graph Diagram.

### CDM-Specific Model Tree Elements

There are four CDM-specific Model Tree elements: Relationship element, Document Model element, Link Relationship element, Link Document Model element.
The root of a CDM is always a Document Model element and all other CDM-specific Model Tree elements are connected to it via a chain of Relationship elements.

#### Document Model Element

This element represents a Document Model. Clicking on it will select it in the tree and simultaneously mark it in the Model Graph Diagram. Its context menu allows to add other elements and to open its Details Editor. It cannot be deleted directly but only by deleting the parent Relationship element. The root Document Model can only be deleted by selecting the 'Delete all elements' option from the context menu of the first default row in the Model Tree called 'Model Tree'.

![context menu document model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/context-menu-document-model.png)

Figure 82. Context Menu of Document Model Element

#### Link Document Model Element

This element represents a Document Model that is used as a Link Document Model. It is always a child node of a Link Relationship Element (see [Link Relationship element](#txt:link_relationship_model_element)). Clicking on it will have no effect. Its context menu allows to open its Details Editor. It cannot be deleted directly but only by deleting the parent Link Relationship element.

![context menu link document model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/context-menu-link-document-model.png)

Figure 83. Context Menu of a Link Document Model Element

#### Relationship Element

This element represents a Relationship Model. It connects two Document Model elements. Its Repetitions value is the maximum multiplicity of its target Document Model element and is automatically inferred from the corresponding Relationship Model on creation.

If it is unbounded, a value of 999,999,999 is used. However, using an unbounded multiplicity is not recommended in a CDM context for security reasons.

The repetitions and the multiplicity have to match, with one exception: For a higher multiplicity the repetitions can also be set to 1. This is allowed for the use case of having a CDM child activity, in which information of one concrete related parent entity of an 'n to m' relationship needs to be displayed.

Clicking on the element will have no effect. Its context menu allows to add elements, to open the Details Editor and to delete it.

![context menu relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/context-menu-relationship.png)

Figure 84. Context Menu of a Relationship Element

#### Link Relationship element

This element is a helper element and purely used to model the connection between a Relationship element and a Link Document Model element. Clicking on it has no effect. Its context menu allows adding elements, opening the Details Editor, and deleting it.

![context menu link relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/context-menu-link-relationship.png)

Figure 85. Context Menu of a Link Relationship Element

### Annotations

Composed Document Models need an Annotation to identify as such and separate it from a regular Document Model. This Annotation is set in the Settings tab. The required Annotation has the name 'cdm.queryRoot' and its value is the name of the root Document Model. This Annotation is set automatically when the root Document Model is selected and must not be changed manually.

![root annotation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/root-annotation.png)

Figure 86. Automatically Set Annotation 'cdm.queryRoot'

Additionally, the Relationship elements require some Annotations that are managed automatically as well:

* 'cdm.relationship': name of the Relationship Model
* 'cdm.sourceRole': role of the source (parent) Document Model
* 'cdm.targetRole': role of the target (child) Document Model
* 'cdm.targetDocumentModel': role of the target Document Model

These Annotations must not be changed manually.

Figure 87. Annotations for a Relationship Element A\_B

### Document Model Element Selection from Diagram

When a Document Model Node in the Diagram is clicked, the corresponding Document Model Element is automatically selected in the Model Tree. If there is more than one tree element of the clicked Document Model, a modal is opened from which the path to the desired tree element can be selected.

![tree node selection modal](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/assets/cdm-editor/tree-node-selection-modal.png)

## Refactoring

The Simple Model Editor supports automatic refactoring for Document Models.
When you rename, move, or delete elements that are referenced elsewhere, the tool identifies affected references and presents options for updating them.

For detailed information about refactoring capabilities, workflow, and actions, refer to the [Refactoring Support](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#refactoring_support) section in the SME Tool Documentation.

### Document Model Specific Refactoring

Document Model refactoring handles references within and between Document Models.
The following elements and reference types are supported:

#### Supported Operations

Document Model refactoring supports the following operations:

* Renaming fields, groups, or includes
* Moving fields or groups to a different parent group
* Deleting fields, groups, includes, or type definitions

#### Reference Types

The following reference types are tracked and updated during Document Model refactoring:

| Reference Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Rule Error Conditions | Conditions that reference fields, for example `[field1] == ""`. |
| Rule Error Messages | Localized error messages that mention field names. |
| Computation Preconditions | Common precondition that reference fields. |
| Computation Operations | Calculations that reference fields. |
| Index Field References | Group index field assignments. |
| Type Definition References | References to type definitions used by fields. |

#### Example: Renaming a Field

Consider a Document Model with:

* A field named `orderDate`
* A rule with error condition `FieldNotFilled(orderDate)`
* A rule with error message "Please enter $orderDate"

When you rename `orderDate` to `purchaseDate`:

1. Save the Document Model.
2. The refactoring dialog displays the affected references:

   * Error condition: `FieldNotFilled(orderDate)` changes to `FieldNotFilled(purchaseDate)`
   * Error message: "Please enter $orderDate" changes to "Please enter $purchaseDate"
3. Select **Commit** for each reference to apply the updates.
4. The model saves with all references updated.

#### Example: Moving a Field

Consider a Document Model with:

* A field named `field1` at the top level
* A computation referencing `field1`

When you move `field1` into a group named `otherGroup`:

1. Save the Document Model.
2. The refactoring dialog displays the affected computation reference.
3. The proposed update changes the path from `field1` to `otherGroup/field1`.
4. Select **Commit** to apply the update, or **Edit** to select a different target.
5. The model saves with your selected changes applied.

For information about enabling or disabling Document Model refactoring, see [Enabling Within-Model Refactoring](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#enabling_refactoring) in the SME Tool Documentation.
