# SME (Module) Development

This documentation gives a brief overview over the SME architecture and provides a guide on how to use the
SME Core to create a new SME module.

## Architectural Overview

![Architectural Overview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dev-docs/assets/Architecture.png)

* The **SME Core** provides the basic SME functionality. The core is independent of both SME Modules and the SME App.
* **SME Modules** add the functionality to display, model, upload, …​ one model and its sub elements.
  They must implement the *SMEModule* interface or extend the *DefaultSMEModule* class.
  Modules depend on the Core, but not on the SME App.
  Furthermore, they can depend on each other in the same way their models depend on each other.
  For this, a module may provide functionality for other modules. Reusable or provided functionality of a module is located
  in the `api` folder of a module. Only functionality in this folder may be reused by other modules, that is, it is not allowed
  that a module *A* uses functionality of a module *B* that is located in a different folder than the `api` folder of *B*
  as depicted in the architectural overview. In case a module needs some functionality of another module
  and this relation coincides with the relation between the corresponding models, the reusable functionality should be moved to the `api` folder.
  Common functionality which is neither module-independent nor can be assigned to a single module should be placed in the
  *Module Commons*. All modules are allowed to depend on *Module Commons*.
* The **SME App** configures the core and registers the modules. Thus, the app may depend on both modules and
  core.

### A12 Extensions

The architecture blocks are reflected in the folder structure of the `src` folder. Besides the `app`, `core`, and
`modules` folders, there is an additional `a12Extension` folder. This folder contains code that is not SME-specific,
but serves as an extension to other A12 products (for example, Client, Kernel, etc.). This code might be moved into
those products in the future as it could also be beneficial for other A12-based projects.

## Middleware and Saga Action Flow

![SME Action Flow](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dev-docs/assets/SMEActionFlow.png)

The SME uses the Form Engine to implement most of the UI components. Whenever a UI component receives user
input, it dispatches an action. While handcrafted react UI components can dispatch the corresponding actions directly,
we need an additional translation from form engine events. This translation as well as reacting on actions that only
affect the UI state of the SME is implemented as part of **UI middlewares**. The corresponding code is organized
according to the corresponding UI components.

SME Features are implemented in the **Logic** component. Asynchronous Actions are handled by *SME Sagas* while synchronous
actions can be handled by *SME Middlewares*. All code that involves a *REST API call*, *Dirty Handling* or that triggers
display of a *progress indicator* is regarded as asynchronous. After processing an asynchronous action, a response action
can be dispatched that is handled by other parts. The corresponding code is organized according to the implemented
feature.

The **Data** component contains only *Reducers* and middlewares that act solely as a replacement for a reducer.
The latter can be the case if data is stored as part of an activity. The corresponding code is implemented according
to the redux state.

## Creating an SME Module

To support a new type of model in the SME, the creation of an own SME module for that model is required.
To implement a new module at least the following parts must be created:

* a module class or object implementing the SMEModule interface (see [Implementation](#Implementation))
* an explorer entry (see [Explorer Entries](#ExplorerEntries))

We encourage the use of A12’s modeling capabilities as much as possible. Thus, using an App Model, a Meta Model
(Document Model), and an Editor Model (Form Model) for the module is recommended.
For starting the development of a new module there are templates for the meta and editor model located in the `resources/models/template` folder. To adhere to the project structure the meta and editor model should be created in a new folder for the module located in `resources/models`. The remaining artifacts should be created in a new folder for the module located in `src/modules`.
After the module is implemented, it must be registered in the SME App.

### Implementation

Only the most basic concepts are explained in this guide.
There exist already a few modules, which can be taken as template for the implementation of new modules.
The following listing shows an excerpt of the *SMEModule* interface.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` export interface SMEModule extends Module {     determineFileTypeIfSupported(ioFile: IOFile): string | undefined;     getExplorerEntryPrototypes(): ExplorerEntry[];     createModelExplorerData(parserFiles: ParserFile[]): ModelExplorerData;     stringifyDocument(document: object): string;     ... } ``` |
```

Alternatively, there is also an abstract class called *DefaultSMEModule* which implements the *SMEModule* interface and provides useful defaults.

#### Supported Types

Each model is responsible to identify its supported types. Therefore, the method *determineFileTypeIfSupported()* must
be implemented. These types are used by the core to identify the relevant modules used for further operations.
Note that:

* The type must equal the type of the implemented ExplorerEntry (see [Explorer Entries](#ExplorerEntries)).
* The order of modules matters (see [Order of Modules](#OrderOfModules)).

#### Explorer Entries

To make a new supported element appear in the explorer, an own class extending *ExplorerEntry* must be implemented.
The following listing demonstrates this based on an excerpt of the *AppModelEntry*:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` export class AppModelEntry extends ExplorerEntry implements Editable {     type = "appModel";     dirty = false;     get isDownloadable(): boolean { return true; }     ... } ``` |
```

Type information such as *isDownloadable* should be added by overriding the getter while a property should be used for
information that belongs to the instance (for example, *dirty*). The type property is an exception as it is used to identify the
type when mapping between pure objects that are stored in the redux store and rich objects that are used for
computations. A single object used as prototype must be registered for each supported in the module
(*getExplorerEntryPrototypes()*).

#### Import, Export, and Upload

To specify the behavior during import, createModelExplorerData must be implemented.

Different behavior for export and upload can be provided by implementing the toFileContentFor{Export,Upload} methods.

### Registration

Modules can be registered using the ModuleRegistry from the A12 Client.

Alternatively, the ModuleRegistryExtension from the SME core can be used:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` import { addOrUpdateModule } from "../../core/module/moduleRegistryExtension";  import { appModelModule } from "./amModule";  addOrUpdateModule(appModelModule);  module.hot?.accept(); ``` |
```

Besides this, the module must be added to the following array in `webpack.common.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` entry: {   main: [     // the order of registration must reflect the order of dependencies between the modules     "./src/modules/documentModel/index.ts",     "./src/modules/modelGraphDiagram/index.ts",     ...     ] }, ``` |
```

This way hot module replacement (HMR) is ensured and changes are integrated immediately without losing the state. However, there are some limitations to HMR. In case an activity for the app model of the changed module exists, a reload is triggered and the state is lost.

#### Order of Modules

The order of modules matters! The first module in the list of registered modules that can support a file,
will be used to determine the file’s type.

## References Inside and Between Models

### Motivation

Models may depend on other models within a workspace (for example, inside the Tree Editor, you need to specify the roles that are defined inside a Relationship Model) or depend on information inside of the model (for example, styles). Currently, every reference is represented by the Autocomplete Widget, which is essentially a DropDown that lets you select the possible values. Since it is not possible to define which values should be displayed at compile time, we need to fill these Autocomplete widgets dynamically.

### Architecture

![Reference Architecture](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dev-docs/assets/ReferenceArchitecture.png)

### How to Create a Reference

#### Inside the Document Model Editor

1. Create following Type Definition if not already done

   1. Name: "Reference" (pay attention to upper- and lower-case letters)
   2. Data Type: "String"

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are including ../core/ModelHeader.json, the correct Type Definition is already included. Type Definitions are located in the right column of the tool. This will be moved out of ../core/ModelHeader.json once the Kernel allows you to include pure Type Definition Documents. |

2. Assign the Type Definition "Reference" as Data Type to every field that should hold dynamic enumeration values
3. Create a rule for each field `FieldFilled(fieldX) AND CustomCondition InvalidReference`

   1. `FieldFilled` is necessary because the error field must be present in the error condition
   2. `Invalid Reference` should be specified as error message
4. If it should be possible for you to enter new (valid) values, add the following annotation to the field

   1. ["AutoCompleteProps" : "allowAddingNewItems"] (pay attention to upper- and lower-case letters)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We customized the deserialize method when the meta models are loaded. Type Definitions will be turned into annotations so we can identify relevant fields later on. If you create an annotation on any StringType with the key "typeDefinition" it will probably not function correctly. |

### Inside the Form Model Editor

1. Drag and Drop it in any section/grid/etc. you like. It will be displayed as a simple String Input

### Inside the Source Code

#### Create an EnumValueProvider

Use the function `createEnumValueProvider(canHandle: ModelPath, getValues: EnumCalculator): EnumValueProvider` to create a new EnumValueProvider

##### Parameter canHandle

You need to specify the ModelPath of your references here. The ModelPath may be defined as an absolute path or a query.
For example given following Document structure in the DataModeler, where `field1` and `field2` are References:

![Reference Document](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-dev-docs/assets/ReferenceDocument.png)

* `ModelPath.fromString("RootGroup/Group1/field2")` is an absolute path and the EnumValueProvider will only handle `field2` inside `RootGroup/Group1`
* `ModelPath.fromString(".field1")` is a query (notice the `.` in front of the name) and the EnumValueProvider will handle **all** paths that end with `…​/field1` (so 3 in this case)
* `ModelPath.fromString(".Group1/field1")` is also a query and the EnumValueProvider will handle **all** paths that end with `…​/Group1/field1` (2 in this case)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The order of EnumValueProviders matters! If you define `.field1` in the first EnumValueProvider and `RootGroup/Group1/field1` in the second EnumValueProvider, the first one matches for all 3 paths and the second one will never be triggered. Generally you should be mindful if you use queries and you need to ensure they are unique and are always handled the same way. |

##### Parameter getValues

After a path matches with the `canHandle` parameter, the function you pass into `getValues` will be called. It has the following interface:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` (path: DocumentPath, model: {}, explorerData: ModelExplorerData, state?: object) => DropDownItem[] ``` |
```

* Parameter `path`: It contains the `DocumentPath` of the reference inside the document. The difference between `DocumentPath` and `ModelPath` is, that `DocumentPath` contains an index for each path segment. This is important to allow your Reference to be inside a repeatable group.
* Parameter `model`: It contains the whole Model that is currently loaded or under evaluation
* Parameter `explorerData`: It contains all models and entries that are currently stored inside the activity SME\_EXPLORER
* Parameter `state`: Contains the whole redux state

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We only guarantee that the activity SME\_EXPLORER exists in the `state`. Other activities may exist depending on the use case, but you cannot assume that they always do. If your EnumValueProvider depends on those other activities, you need to implement a fallback solution. |

The function should return an array of `DropDownItems`. It is recommended to use `createDropDownItem(value: string, label = value): DropDownItem` from the core. Label should be set if you want the form to display a different value than what is actually stored inside the model (for example, to give you a readable value instead of an alphanumerical id).

#### Register EnumValueProviders in Your SME Module

1. Overwrite the `getEnumValues` method from the DefaultSMEModule if not already done
2. It is recommended to use following pattern:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` getEnumValues(path: DocumentPath, model: {}, explorerData: ModelExplorerData): DropDownItem[] | undefined {     const provider = resolveEnumValueProvider(path, enumValueProviderArray);      return provider?.getValues(path, model, explorerData); } ``` |
```

3. Using `resolveEnumValueProvider` will:

   1. automatically convert the `DocumentPath` to a `ModelPath` to find the corresponding `EnumValueProvider`
   2. handle the matching between `DocumentPath` and the queries defined inside `EnumValueProviderArray`
4. the second parameter `enumValueProviderArray` is an array of type `EnumValueProvider` that you have defined in the previous step and need to pass in

## Locale Synchronization

### Motivation

Models usually specify supported languages in their Header as **Locale** (for example, *de, en*). In their Content models may offer **Localized Elements** which you can edit depending on the defined Locales of the Header (for example, column labels depending on the Locales *de, en*). **Localized Elements** and **Locales** need to stay synchronized while you are editing the model.

The SME offers a built-in mechanism for this use case under the assumption that:

* the model conforms to the Header API of the model-api package
* the model is edited by a form engine.

### Technical Design

If the Locales in the Header are changed (added, edited or deleted) all localized element occurrences inside the Content need to be synchronized. A Middleware registers the value change event of the Locales and dispatches `ModelEditorActions.synchronizeLocales`. The corresponding `Activity.DataReducer` will simply query the document searching for registered **Locale Interfaces** and apply the new **Locale**.

If a Detached Repeat is created, **Localized Elements** need to be created from scratch. A Middleware registers the new Detached Repeat Event and dispatches `ModelEditorActions.addLocalizedElements`. The corresponding `Activity.DataReducer` traverses the Meta Model looking for registered **Locale Interfaces** and creates **Localized Elements** if necessary.

### How to Register for Locale Synchronization

Simply add `[EditorFeatures.localize]: true` to the activity descriptor of the form engine (default setting of the `DefaultSMEModule`). Delete / Leave out the property if the model should not be localized.

Meta models should include the Document Model **DomainLocalizedText** for every localizable element. If this is not possible, the fields of **DomainLocalizedText** need to be recreated. Pay attention to the annotations of the fields.
For the locale field, the annotation {$smeAnnotation$: locale} must be added. For the text field, the annotation {$smeAnnotation$: localizedText} has to be present.

Deprecated:
**Localized Elements** need to be modelled as a repeatable group containing two string fields in the Document Model. The name of the three elements is important, by default the SME supports following **Locale Interface** of the model-api package:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` {     "groupKey": "labels",     "localeKey": "locale",     "textKey": "text" } ``` |
```

So in the Document Model the repeatable group needs to be named *labels*, the field containing the locale should be named *locale* and the field containing the text should have the name *text*.

If all your **Localized Elements** follow this interface the synchronization should work out of the box. Your module may register additional **Locale Interfaces** by implementing `getLocaleInterfaces(): LocaleInterface[]` of the `SMEModule` in case it is necessary.
WARNING: Follow the default if you can decide on your own. Currently, there is effort to align the
localized elements across all modules. Thus, custom localized elements might not be supported in the future!

### Notes on Deleting Empty Localized Elements

If your module decides to delete empty **Localized Elements** on export it also has to make sure to add them again on import. Since the **SMEAction.addLocalizedElements** is also dispatched on loading of the model and it queries the underlying meta model, it is sufficient to create an empty object.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

We use three mechanisms to register keyboard shortcuts:

* via the onKeyDown/onKeyUp callbacks of React/HTML Elements
* via the `keyboardShortcuts` API of the tree engine
* via a custom, annotation based solution for form engine components

### Modeling Keyboard Shortcuts in Form Models

Keyboard shortcuts are directly mapped to the buttons (event and navigation buttons) that are modelled in the form model. Our mechanism recognizes annotations directly on buttons that have the key `keyboardShortcut`. For example, to trigger a button event that should be dispatched when `Control`, `Shift` and `Enter` are pressed simultaneously, following annotation must be added via the Form Model Editor:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` {     "key": "keyboardShortcut",     "value": "Control + Shift + Enter" } ``` |
```

Following limitations apply:

* The modifier keys must match the values defined by [keycode-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycode-js), so for example `Control` can **not** be abbreviated with `Ctrl`
* Only Control, Alt and Shift are supported as modifier keys
* Modifier keys must be provided first
* The last key may not be one of the modifier keys
* Keys have to be separated by `+`
* Capitalization and spaces between keys are ignored

### Implementation

The Form Engine View must be wrapped within `FormEngineKeyboardWrapper` unless you already use `EnhancedFormEngine` from `core`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` export function FormEngineWithKeyboardShortcuts(props: FormEngineViews.FormEngineProps) {     return (         <FormEngineKeyboardWrapper {...props}>             <FormEngineViews.FormEngine {...props} />         </FormEngineKeyboardWrapper>     ); } ``` |
```

## Testing (End-to-End)

End-to-End tests are realized using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

Test files should be placed in `cypress\integration`, fixed data in `cypress\testData`, and support commands in `cypress\support\commands.ts` with type definitions in `cypress\support\commands.d.ts`.

Example test using a custom command:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` describe("Test basic functionality", () => {     it("should load the basic workspace with its installer-appmodel file", () => {         cy.visit("");         cy.loadWorkspaceExplorerDataFromJson(workspaceBasicExplorerData);         cy.contains(".treeWidget__nodeName a", "installer-appmodel").should("exist");     }); }); ``` |
```

## Electron

The SME uses [electron](https://www.electronjs.org) to develop a cross-platform desktop app with web technologies (TypeScript, HTML, CSS, etc.).
Electron is based on Chromium and NodeJS and abstracts OS- and desktop-specific parts from the actual app implementation.
Therefore, the SME app is wrapped in Electron to create the desktop app.

We make use of the `electron-builder` to package and build distribution-ready desktop apps. Currently, the SME is offered as Windows, Linux, and MacOS application and the result of building the app with electron is an OS-specific executable.

### Architecture of the SME Electron App

The SME Electron app is composed from three components:

* The **loading screen** appears when the app is started. It shows a spinner while in the background, the server is started. When this is finished, the app shows the main window.
* The **main screen** shows the actual SME app in the same way it would be shown in a browser window.
* The **server** runs the SME backend in a separated Java process. To achieve this, the correct path to the Java installation must be provided in the `settings` file.

The app is accompanied by

* The **settings.json** file that contains the path to the Java call. By default this is `"java"`, that is, it is assumed that the java path is set in the system environment variables.
* This is also used by the installer to point to the shipped JDK
* If the app is installed manually and the path has not been set correctly, typical symptoms are that the loading screen will remain permanently or an error dialog with "Error: spawn […​] java […​] at ChildProcess" appears. In any case, the backend log can give further information.
* **sme-backend.jar** contains the SME backend
* The **smtsolver** directory contains the solver(s) used in the backend, for example, to calculate rule contradictions in document models.

### How to build the SME App?

Building the SME app is fully integrated in gradle. Developers can call `gradle package{Win, Linux, Mac}ElectronApp` for the OS that the build is triggered on. Builds for foreign OSs are currently not supported. Instead, virtual machines or remote access to other machines, for example, via CI nodes, must be used.

In short, the build comprises the following activities:

* Frontend and backend are built
* Loading screen, main window, and server are built
* Electron app is built
* Additional resources are integrated/copied

  + `settings.json`, `sme-backend.jar`, `smtsolver` directory
  + intermediate result located in `electron/build/electron`
* result is packaged: `sme-app-{win, linux}.zip`, `sme-app-mac.tgz`

  + located in `electron/build/packaged`

#### macOS-Specific Build Parts

##### Notarization

Apple has a GateKeeper that checks apps not downloaded via the AppStore.
If apps are not properly signed and notarized, MacOS complicates their execution. These apps can still be executed, for example, via right-click/open or by deactivating GateKeeper. Apps can be notarized to avoid this.

To apply successful notarization, developers need an Apple production certificate in the keychain, an Apple ID, and Xcode. All this is already configured in the Jenkins Mac nodes the SME uses.
Notarization is performed via `electron-notarize` during the electron build. It executes a notarization script to sign the code and indicate entitlements. This is realized in `/electron/build-mac`.

##### Translocation

Apple copies apps to mounted read-only disk images and executes them there. This is problematic, for example, if external resources are used.
To overcome this "translocation", the SME performs an "untranslocation": On start, the SME checks whether it is translocated. If so, it removes its quarantine attribute, and restarts itself. This is
realized in `/electron/mainWindow/translocation.ts`.

#### Build Process in the CI and Manual Build Testing

Electron build & publication to Artifactory triggered when
building a tag or for nightly builds of master or release branch.

Hence, for builds of feature branches or pull requests, the electron build is not triggered by default. To test OS-specific or Electron-related implementations, the `jenkinsfile` is parametrizable with the option "ArchiveElectronBuild".
The value for the option can be set in the "Build with parameters" tab of Jenkins. Developers can choose between archiving no builds, the build for macOS, the build for linux, or both. Currently it is assumed that the Windows build can be triggered locally, hence this option is not selectable.
On success, the artifacts of the build are archived in Jenkins and can be downloaded from the Jenkins build page. After a while, the files are deleted together with all other information about the build.

### View the Log Files

All log messages are printed to log files. The location of these files is a folder 'log' next to the executable of the SME Electron build.

Currently, we distinguish between three different log files
- **backend.log** contains the log messages from the backend
- **frontend.log** contains the log messages from the frontend. Currently, this log file is only prototypical.
- **electron.log** contains all remaining log messages that mainly arise in the configuration of electron or the management of frontend and backend as child processes

New log messages are added at the end of the log files. All files have a maximum size of 1 mb. When a log file reaches its maximum size, its content is moved to an archived version of the file that, again, has a maximum size of 1 mb.

### Support for Finding Bugs

Proper [debugging of Electron apps](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/application-debugging) with IDE debuggers is difficult, because different processes are involved (for example, frontend, backend, electron). Therefore, we introduced logging to inspect errors in the log files and support developers in creating (temporary) debug output that can be inspected in the log files, too.

Moreover, developers can enable the Chromium devtools for electron
by calling `win.webContents.openDevTools()`. These enable the usual means for finding bugs, for example, by inspecting the console, setting breakpoints, etc.

### Enable Redux Dev Tools and Load Source Maps in Electron

**Step 1**: Ensure that the Chrome DevTools are enabled, if required also in the packaged app (via `win.webContents.openDevTools()` in `main.ts`). Alternatively, comment out the removal of the window menu (`win.removeMenu()`), which will then offer the option to start the DevTools.

**Step 2**: Configure the Redux DevTool extension as described [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/devtools-extension).
In case of Windows, the result may be adding the following lines to main.ts:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` const reactDevToolsPath = path.join( process.env.APPDATA!, "../Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Extensions/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd/3.1.3_0" );  void app 	.whenReady() 	.then(async () => { await session.defaultSession.loadExtension(reactDevToolsPath) }) 	.then(loadingScreen) 	.then(smeWindow); ``` |
```

**Step 3**: Make the `copyDist` and the `copySettings` tasks in the electron gradle build depend on `packageDistDirQA` instead of `packageDistDirWebapp`.
Additionally, the source directory in `copyDist` has to be changed to `from("${parent?.buildDir}/qa/dist")`

## Guidelines

### Focus Handling

After opening a detail activity from a master activity (model from workspace explorer; element from document model tree)
the focus should be automatically set to an element of the detail view.

#### Guideline

* If the detail is implemented using the form engine:

  + The focus is in the first focusable input element
* If the detail is implemented using the tree engine (with virtual root node):

  + The focus is on the virtual root node of the tree if the model has elements
  + the focus is on the ADD button if the model has no elements

### Invalid Existing References

In [[References inside and between models]](#References inside and between models), the definition of references was described. This approach handles invalid existing
references in the same way as non-existing references: A generic error message is shown.
To provide a better user experience, the two cases should be handled differently.

#### Guideline

Invalid existing references should be displayed with a specific error message describing why the reference is invalid.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This can be achieved using custom conditions. |

### Non-Editable Models

In some cases models loaded by the SME cannot be edited. Currently there are following types of problems:

* incompatible major version
* newer minor version
* older minor version (can be migrated by the SME)
* models with a critical level of invalidity (for example, error during the loading process)
* models where the id does not match the file name

#### Guideline

Disable the complete workspace if such issues exist and display hints listing those models and a strategy to proceed.

### Meta Model Version

The SME should be usable to model the Meta Models of the SME itself.

#### Guideline

Meta Models should always be editable by at least one SME version without the need for any migration. Moreover, no validation errors should exist after performing the workspace validation.

### Build Process

#### Guideline: Reproducible Build Results

Executing the build several times should produce the same results.

Exception: Docker images which are provided as official artifacts should always use up-to-date base images!
Thus, the latest image can be chosen automatically.

#### Guideline: Do Not Modify Source Files During Build

All files that are automatically created or adapted during the build process need to be excluded from version control.

Reason: The version for published artifacts is calculated based on the git status.

#### Guideline: Incremental Build

Already executed task of the build process should not be executed again, if no relevant changes have been applied to
their input files since the last execution.

Exception: If the time saving is not relevant (up-to-date check takes time too).

### Use of Kernel API

The **external** api from kernel is designed to be used for all applications that use the kernel. Changes to the api are documented in the changelog.
Artifacts of the external api are usually contained in a package that has `api` as a segment.

The **a12 internal** api from kernel is designed specifically for internal A12 components and should be used wherever possible in the SME backend. It offers more functionality than the external api, but changes are not necessarily documented in the changelog.
Artifacts of the a12 internal api are usually contained in a package that has `a12internal` as a segment.

The **internal** kernel artifacts are designed to be used within the kernel.
Internal artifacts are usually contained in a package that has `internal` as a segment.

#### Guideline

* Use the **a12 internal** api whenever possible. Otherwise, use the **external** api. Usage of kernel’s internal artifacts should be avoided.
* If it is necessary to use an internal artifact (because the functionality is not provided via an api yet), notify the kernel team.
* As a rule of thumb the preferred package should always be `kernel.core`. If something does not exist there, the package should always include a12internal (for example, `kernel.md.model.a12internal`) or api (for example, `kernel.md.model.api`)

## Creating Plugins

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This feature is in an experimental state and currently only custom elements for the Content Model Editor can be registered. There is no dedicated marketplace to retrieve plugins yet, instead projects need to build and share them manually. |

Install our node CLI Tool:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install '@com.mgmtp.a12.sme/plugin-builder' ``` |
```

Use the following command to create a plugin:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npx sme-plugin-builder --entry src/index.ts --outDir lib --id my-plugin --name \"My Plugin\" --pluginVersion 1.0.0 --type content-model-plugin --targetSmeVersion 12.2.0 ``` |
```

For further explanations to the arguments, use **npx sme-plugin-builder --help** for more information.

In your code, you must call the registering function with the code you want to register.
