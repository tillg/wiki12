# Query Modeling

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Query Model and the editor are an experimental feature. It must be enabled in the SME Tool Settings before use; see [Enabling Experimental Module Types](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#enabling_experimental_modules). |

## Introduction and Concepts

The Query Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor (SME) and enables domain experts, analysts and developers to create and modify Query Models for business applications.
The Query Model defines the data set that shall be used for a given business requirement:

1. Which Documents should be included in the data set? (Filtering)
2. Should all or only certain Fields of these Documents be included?
3. Should the Documents be sorted? (Sorting)
4. Which portion of the Documents should be retrieved? (Paging)
5. Should also Linked Documents be loaded? (Projection)

Query Models can be referenced in Overview Models to define the Data Set that is accessible by the end user. (See Overview Modeling > Base Query.)
The Query Model and the resulting data set can also be used in custom implementations.
In this way, a modeler can define the business requirements for the data set and hand them over to a developer in form of a Query Model.

An example of Query Model usage can be seen in the Advanced Workspace that is available with the A12 Installer.

### Example Use Case

In an HR Management System, a business requirement is to show a dedicated list of all fulltime employees (we consider 35 weekly work hours or more as fulltime).
Whether a person works fulltime or not, can be determined by the contract that is linked to them.

Taking the advanced example workspace as a basis, the formalized business requirement would be:
A list that shows the *FirstName* and *LastName* of all Person documents that have a Link of the PersonContract Relationship to a Contract document, on which Field *WeeklyWorkhours* has a value greater or equal to 35.

![example query 01](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/example_query_01.png)

Figure 1. Query Model Yielding Persons Having Contracts With *WeeklyWorkhours* >= 35

With a custom implementation, we would like to add a symbol in each list row that represents a person that is a team lead.
In order to implement this requirement, the query must additionally yield all teams, where the person’s position is specified to be a team lead.

Taking the advanced example workspace as a basis, the formalized business requirement would be:
A list that shows the *FirstName* and *LastName* of all Person documents that have a Link of the PersonContract Relationship to a Contract document, on which Field *WeeklyWorkhours* has a value greater or equal to 35.
For each of them, additionally load *TeamName* of all Team documents that are linked via Relationship TeamPerson, where the Link Field *Position* exactly equals "Team Lead".

![example query 02](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/example_query_02.png)

Figure 2. Query Model Yielding Persons Having Contracts With *WeeklyWorkhours* >= 35 and Their Linked Teams Where Position Is Team Lead

This Query would yield two lists of entities:

1. All the Person documents, that fulfill the Filter Definition: Has("PersonContract", "Contract", [/Contract/WeeklyWorkhours] >= 35)
2. For each of those selected documents, all linked Team documents and the respective Link Fields Document where the Link Fields document fulfills the Filter Definition: [/LinkFields/Position] == "Team Lead"

In a custom implementation, a frontend developer can pick up these results and show a respective icon, if at least one Link for the document shown in the row is present.
When hovering above the icon, a list with all the team names can be shown.

The business requirement, when the symbol is shown, is modeled.
If the business requirement would change to also take "Team Co-Lead" into account, then this can be changed in the Query Model.
No code change would be needed.

The first list represents the Target Document Model of the Query Model.
It is always the first entry of the Model Tree of the Query Model Editor.
In A12 Data Services, this list is filled during the Selection phase of the query execution.

The second list represents the links section of the Query Model.
It is determined by all the other elements of the Model Tree of the Query Model Editor.
In A12 Data Services, this list is filled during the Projection phase of the query execution.

The corresponding Query Model content and its query result are shown herein. Click to expand.

| Query | Data Services Result |

### Filter Definition

Filter Definitions are the central modeling feature of Query Models.
They define which documents and links will be added to the Query Result Set.

They are shown in the Model Tree and can be edited in the Document Model Element Editor after clicking on a Document Model Element.

The following language constructs are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use [Ctrl]+[Space] within the Filter Definition editor to show suggestions. |

To get more information about the language constructs and to see usage examples, please enter the term in the Filter Definition editor and hover above it.
An info box with more information will be shown.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Operator | Description |
| [/path/to/field] | The Field Value Operator can be used to reference a Field of the current Document Model. The current Document Model is shown in the right bottom corner of the editor. In the first place this is the Document Model of the Document Model Element. When using the Has-Operator this could also be the Link Fields Document Model or the linked Document Model.  Fields that have the Annotation `Indexed` = `False` cannot be used in Filter Definitions. |
| Not, And, Or | Logical Operators to concatenate Filter Statements logically. Round brackets must be used together with `Not` or if `And` and `Or` are used together. |
| ==, ~, !=, !~, >= , <= | Unitary Value Comparison Operators compare a Field specified by a Field Value Operator with a constant value. The constant value must match the data type of the Field. This is ensured by modeling support in the editor.  It can be specified, whether the value of the Field must exactly match the constant value (`==`) or a case-insensitive substring search (`~`) should be done.  By default, at least three characters must be given for the `~` and `!~` Operator; this can be changed with Data Service configuration.  `Null` can be used together with `==` and `!=` |
| Date, Time, DateTime, DateFragment, DateRange | Language constructs to create date and time constants for comparison by unitary value comparison operators or InRange operator. |
| Match | One or many Field Value Operators can be given together with at least one Constant Values to the Match Operator. It is fulfilled, if any of the given constant values is a case-insensitive sub-string of the data in any of the given Fields. If no Field is given, all Fields of the Document Model Element, that do not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`, are taken into account. |
| InRange | The InRange Operator takes a Field Value Operator and two constant values.  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` InRange([/Group/Field],3,9) ``` | ```  is logically equal to  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` [/Group/Field] >= 3 And [/Group/Field] <= 9 ``` | ```  but the InRange construct is much faster. |
| Has | The Has Operator expects the following arguments:  1. Relationship Model: Name of a Relationship Model in which the current Document Model is referenced in any Role. 2. Role: Name of the other Role in the Relationship Model.    In case of a self-referencing Relationship this is needed; in all other cases it is explicitly specified to mitigate modeling mistakes. 3. Filter Definition for the linked Document Model:  It can be specified that the linked document must fulfill the given Filter Definition.    The Filter Definition editor will switch the current Document Model and suggest Field references according to the Document Model of the respective Role.  Can be `Null`, if no Filter Definition should be applied.  Must be set, if a Filter Definition for the Link Fields Document Model shall be added. 4. Filter Definition for the Link Fields Document Model:    It can be specified that the Link Fields document of the link must fulfill the given Filter Definition.    The Filter Definition editor will switch the current Document Model and suggest Field references according to the Link Fields Document Model of the Relationship Model.  Can be `Null`, if no Filter Definition should be applied.  |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | The Has operator is fulfilled, if any link exists, where both Filter Definitions are met for the same link. | |
| Null | * Placeholder in the Has Operator, if no Filter Definition for the respective Document Model is needed. * Representation of an empty database Field when used with == or != .  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  | ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` [/Group/Field] != Null ``` | ```  matches all documents, where Field */Group/Field* has any value. Documents where Field */Group/Field* is empty are not included in the Result.  There is Data Service configuration to specify if an empty Field of Type Number is matched by `0` (as it would be treated by Kernel in a Computation) or by `Null`. | |

## Installation

The Query Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor. For advice on the installation of the Simple Model Editor, refer to the "Quick Start Guide" on getA12 under "Modeling".

### Migrating Existing Models to a New Version of the Tools

It might be necessary to migrate existing Query Models in case a new version of the Simple Model Editor and thus Query Model Editor has been installed.

In most cases, the Simple Model Editor can handle updating versions itself. For more information, refer to the documentation of the Simple Model Editor.

## Editor Functions

### Opening the Query Model Editor

To access the Query Model Editor, open a Workspace in the Simple Model Editor (SME).
All models contained in the Workspace are displayed in the SME Workspace Explorer.
Query Models are recognized by the SME and are indicated with the "Qe" icon

![workspace explorer](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/workspace_explorer.png)

Figure 3. SME Workspace Explorer Containing a Query Model

To open the Query Model Editor for an existing model, click the entry in the Workspace Explorer.

To create a new Query Model, use the "ADD" button in the header of the Workspace Explorer or the context menu of a folder, and select "Query Model".

![add query model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/add-query-model.png)

Figure 4. Add a New Query Model

A modal will then be displayed to define the mandatory model settings: **Folder**, **Name** and **Target Document Model**.

![add query model modal](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/add-query-model-modal.png)

Figure 5. Enter Initial Model Settings for New Query Model

The **Name** of the model must be unique within the Workspace.

### Query Model Contents

#### Settings

The Settings Screen contains the following elements:

Name
:   The name of the Query Model.
    It must use only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods. The name must not start with "xml" and must be at most 100 characters long.

    The model name must be unique within the Workspace and is synchronized with the filename by the editor.

Model Version
:   Shows the version of the opened model.

Description
:   Multiline text providing additional information about the query specified by the Query Model.

Locales
:   A list of locales supported by the model. Each locale is represented by a row in the table.

    At least one locale must be entered. Only locale codes according to ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 are allowed.
    A region code may be added after an underscore, such as de\_DE or de\_CH.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Locales are currently only used to specify Query Model Labels. |

Labels
:   These fields store a list of labels for the model, one for each specified locale.

    The labels can be used as a localizable representation of the model itself in a list of different models. E.g. in a model repository.

Roles
:   A list of Roles can be maintained in this table.

Annotations
:   An Annotation is a name-value pair that can be added to the model.
    Applications using the Query Model can access these Annotations and use them in custom implementations.

#### Model Tree

The Model Tree Screen can be seen in [Figure 6](#fig:query-model-content).

![query model content](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/query-model-content.png)

Figure 6. Query Model Editor - Model Tree Screen With Model Tree, Document Model Element Editor, and Element Picker

The Model Tree represents the quality and quantity of the Result Set the query will yield.
It consists of **Document Model Elements**, **Relationship Model Elements** and the content of the respective Document Models (Groups, Fields, …​).

Name
:   The hierarchical column of the Model Tree shows the nested structure of the Query Model and lists

    Target Document Model Element
    :   The first Document Model Element of the Model Tree represents the Target Document Model.
        It has some special properties that can be changed in the editor for the Document Model Element.

    Relationship Model Element
    :   Starting from the Target Document Model Element, any number of Relationships can be followed and the respective linked documents are added to the Result Set.
        The Relationship Model Element represents a followed Relationship.
        They can be nested inside other Relationship Model Elements.

        The Document Model, that is referenced in the other Role of the Relationship Model, is shown nested under the Relationship Model Element.
        If a Link Fields Document Model is specified in the Relationship Model, then this will be present as well.

    Document Model Element
    :   Document Model Elements represent the Document Models for which data will be retrieved.
        For each of those, a Filter Definition and a list of Fields can be maintained in the editor.

        Only for the Document Model Elements a Detail Editor is opened.

In Result
:   The checkboxes in the rows of the Model Tree that represent Fields indicate, whether the data of this Field will be present in the query’s Result Set or not.
    If a Field has the Annotation `indexed` = `false` in the Document Model, then the checkbox will be disabled.
    Fields with this Annotation can only be added to the Result Set, if `All Fields of Document Model` is selected in the Document Model Element Editor of the respective Document Model Element.
    The value of the checkbox corresponds to the section "Fields included in Result Set" of the Document Model Element Editor.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | If `All Fields of Document Model` was selected for a Document Model Element and any checkbox for a Field nested within this Document Model Element is deselected, then all checkboxes for Fields, that have Annotation `indexed` = `false`, are deselected as well. This reflects that the method of retrieving the result will be changed from the slower document-from-database to the faster fields-from-index approach. |

    When clicking the checkbox within the row of a Group, then the checkbox of all subelements of this Group will be changed accordingly.

    If a Relationship Model Element refers to a self-referencing Relationship, then an input box will be shown, that specifies how often the Relationship will be followed.

Filter Definition
:   This column of the Model Tree shows a simplified version of the Filter Definition that will be applied to the respective Document Model Element.
    It can be changed in the Document Model Element Editor, where more information about the functional
    An overview about the language constructs is given [here](#txt:intro:filterdefition).

    For Relationship Model Elements it states an info text which Filter Definitions will be applied when adding the respective Relationship Links to the Result Set.
    The concrete Filter Definitions must be changed on the Document Model Elements.

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | The Filter Definitions will only act locally. A Filter Definition specified on the Target Document Model will not be taken into account when adding Relationship Links to the Result Set.  If the Filter Definition on a Person Target Document Model would state  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` Has("TeamPerson", "Team", Null, [/LinkFields/Position] == "Team Lead") ``` | ```  and no Filter Definition is specified within the TeamPerson Relationship Model Element, then the query yields all persons, that are linked with position "Team Lead" and **all** their linked teams. If only those teams, where the person is linked as team lead should be added to the Result Set, then the Filter Definition must be repeated on the Document Model Element, that represent the Relationship Link Fields. |

##### Add an Element

The first element of the Model Tree is the Target Document Model Element, it is usually added while creating the Query Model using the Add Query Model Modal.

When selecting a Document Model Element in the Model Tree then the respective Document Model node is highlighted (light blue background) in the [Element Picker](#txt:querymodel:elementpicker) and all Relationship Model nodes that are connected to it are active (dark blue border).

When clicking on an active Relationship Model node in the Element Picker, the Relationship Model Element, its respective Document Model Element and (if specified) a Link Fields Document Model Element are added to the Query Model.

If the Relationship Model has the same Document Model referenced in both Roles, a Modal is shown to select the Role for which the nested Document Model Element shall be added.

##### Element Editor

Only the Document Model Elements can be edited.
Clicking on a Document Model Element in the tree opens the [Document Model Element Editor](#txt:documentmodelelement:editor) and highlights the respective element in the Element Picker.

In the bottom right of the Detail Editor, buttons to apply the changes to the element ("APPLY") or discard the changes to the element ("CANCEL") are displayed.

##### Filtering the Model Tree

Initially, the Model Tree shows all Fields of the respective Document Models but hides the metadata.
This can be changed by clicking the Filter Icon in the header of the Model Tree:

![filter model elements](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/filter_model_elements.png)

Figure 7. Filter Options for Fields in the Document Model Elements

##### Actions in Model Tree

Actions in the Model Tree can mainly be found in the context menu of the virtual root node and the model element nodes via the three dot icon or a right click on each row.

![context menu rmelement](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/context-menu-rmelement.png)

Figure 8. Context Menu Containing Node Actions for a Relationship Model Element

###### Delete

It is possible to delete Relationship Model Elements from the Model Tree.
All sub elements and also nested Relationship Model Elements are deleted from the Query Model as well.

##### Expand and Collapse

Single nodes such as Document and Relationship Model elements, Groups, Includes, Multi-Selects, and Attachments can be expanded and collapsed using the arrow icon left of the element name.

It is possible to expand or collapse all elements of the model using the virtual Model Tree node.

In addition, it is possible to expand or collapse all elements inside a specific node using the node actions "Expand All" and "Collapse All" in the node’s context menu.

##### Delete All Elements

Delete all nodes of the current Query Model.

##### Add Target Document Model Element

If no Document Model Element is present in the Model Tree, either because no Target Document was selected in the Add Query Model Dialog or because all elements were deleted, then a Target Document Model Element can be added.

#### Post Processing

The Post Processing Screen can be seen in [Figure 9](#fig:query-model-postprocessing).

![query model postprocessing](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/assets/query-model-postprocessing.png)

Figure 9. Query Model Editor - Post Processing Screen

The Post Processing Screen contains the following elements:

Sorting
:   A list of sort fields can be maintained here.
    The sorting will be applied to the documents of the Target Document Model.
    All non-repeatable Fields of the Target Document Model, that do not have the Annotation `indexed` = `false`, can be selected here.
    For more information, please see [Data Services > Sorting](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#sorting)

Paging
:   Defines what portion (page) of the results will be present in the Result Set.
    If `Exclude All Root Documents` is set to true in the Target Document Model Element Editor, then this specifies the number of **sorted** documents of the Target Document Model (elements in query result "entries").
    Otherwise, it specifies the number of links (n linked documents and n Link Fields documents in query result "links").

    Page Number
    :   The index of the portion (page) of the result. Starting from 0.

    Page Size
    :   If `Exclude All Root Documents` = false, then this specifies how many documents of the Target Document Model are included.
        If `Exclude All Root Documents` = true, then this specifies how many links should be included. The query results "links" section will contain n linked documents and n Link Fields documents if the size is set to n.

Aggregation
:   If not the documents of the Target Document Model Elements themselves, but just statistical information about them is of interest in the Query’s use case, the `Aggregate Results` switch can be turned on.

    Results can only be aggregated, if the Query Model contains only a Target Document Model Element (no Relationship Model Element) and `Structure of Result Set (Projection)` = `document`.

    The settings for Sorting and Paging are ignored.

    Aggregate Results
    :   If yes, then the query will not result documents or links but only the Aggregation Result.
        The following options are available for this setting:

    Group Documents in Result By
    :   A list of non-repeatable Fields of the Target Document Model, that do not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`.
        An entry for each combination of the values of the listed Fields will be created in the Aggregation results.

    Aggregations For Grouped Results
    :   For each of the entries defined by the Grouping above, the result of the Aggregation will be returned.

#### Element Picker

If the Model Tree is open in the editor, the Element Picker is shown on the left side.
It allows to add new elements to the Model Tree by clicking on active Relationship Model nodes (dark blue border) with the left mouse button.

All Relationship Model nodes that have the currently highlighted Document Model (light blue background) referenced in one of its Relationship Roles are shown as active.

When selecting a Document Model Element in the Model Tree, the respective Document Model node is highlighted in the Element Picker (if it exists in the Model Graph Diagram).
Select a different Model Graph Diagram if the elements you want to add to the Query Model are not present in the initially selected one.
More information about creating a Model Graph Diagram and editing it can be found in the [Model Graph Diagram Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-diagram-ba-docs/index.html).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Click onto the diagram canvas with the right mouse button and hold it to move the canvas. It is also possible to change the width of Element Picker. |

Select the Document Model Element in the Model Tree, for which linked documents should be retrieved in the Query.
Then click on the respective Relationship Model node in the Element Picker to add the Relationship Model Element to the tree.

If the Relationship Model has the same Document Model referenced in both Roles, a Modal is shown to select the Role for which the nested Document Model Element shall be added.

### Validation

Upon opening or changing a Query Model, a consistency check is done.
Among other things, it validates that:

* The Fields selected in the In Result column are present in the respective Document Model and do not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`.
* The Filter Definitions only reference Fields that are present in the respective Document Model and do not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`.
* Sorting and Aggregation is only done on non-repeatable Fields that are present in the Target Document Model and do not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`.

### Refactoring Across Models

Currently, only renaming of the referenced Document Models are refactored in the Query Models.
Changes within the referenced Document and Relationship Models, such as Field name or Role changes, will not automatically be reflected in the Query Model.

## Document Model Element Editor

The Document Model Element Editor opens, when a Document Model Element in the Model Tree is clicked.

Document Model
:   Name of the Document Model, that is referenced by the Document Model Element.
    It cannot be changed.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | If the Query Model should reference a different Target Document Model, create a new Query Model and select the correct Document Model in the Add Query Model Modal. |

Structure of Result Set (Projection)
:   Only shown for the Target Document Model Element.

    Currently only "document" can be selected.
    In this case, the results for the Target Document Model are in the structure of a regular document.

Exclude All Root Documents
:   Only shown for the Target Document Model Element.

    If not the Target Documents but only the Links retrieved by further Relationship Model Elements are needed in the Query Result, then this setting can be checked to optimize performance.

    If it is set to true, the pagination settings are applied on the linked documents that are retrieved.

Filter Definition
:   A Filter Definition describes the properties a document must fulfill in order to be included in the Result Set of the query.
    See [Filter Definition](#txt:intro:filterdefition) for an overview of available language constructs.
    It is translated by the editor into the technical Query Constraints interpreted by Data Services.

    |  |  |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | The Query Model editor creates the Filter Definition from the technical Constraints that are persisted in the Query Model. This conversion is done every time the Filter Definition editor is left. Additional line breaks or tabs will be lost. It is not possible to retain any custom formatting of the Filter Definition.  The editor will display the Filter Definition in its most readable form. Therefore, when entering  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` Match([/Group/Field],"Test") ``` | ```  the editor will convert it into  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` [/Group/Field] ~ "Test" ``` | ``` |

Fields included in Result Set
:   By default, `All Fields of Document Model` is set to false, so a list of Fields is shown.
    Any Field, that does not have Annotation `indexed` = `false`, can be selected.
    Only the respective data for these Fields will be included in the Result Set.

    If `All Fields of Document Model` is selected, then the complete Document will be retrieved from the database.
    To optimize performance, only the needed Fields should be included in the Result Set.
    The data for these Fields will then be taken from the Index and not from the database, which is much faster.
    Moreover, less data has to be transferred to the Client, which improves the loading performance for the end user.

    The list of Fields represents the state of the checkboxes in the `In Result` column of the Model Tree.

## Glossary

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Query | The specification for a function call to a database service. In A12 Data Services provides methods to run Queries and return the result. The result of a Query is a **Result Set**. Depending on the Result Set, it can be used directly in A12 Engines or in custom implementations.  The Query defines the quality (which elements are selected from the database) and quantity (how many of them; what portion of their data) of the Result Set. |
| Query Model | A Query Model specifies a Query. Usually it is enriched with runtime context data. For example in an overview, the original Query is enriched with the page and sorting information the end user sets. |
| Filter Definition | Which documents are retrieved from the database is defined by the Filter Definition. Only documents that fulfill the Filter Definition will be added to the Result Set.  The Filter Definition is the modelers representation of the technical Constraints persisted in the Query Model. |
| Constraint | Filter Definitions are persisted in the Query Model in the form of Constraints. Constraints reflect the technical implementation of querying in Data Services. See [Data Services > Selection](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_selection) for more technical details. |
| Document Model Element | A kind of element that is shown in the Query Model Tree. It represents a Document Model, so a type of documents that can be found in the Result Set of the query.  This can also be a Link Field Document Model used in a Relationship Model.  On these elements, the Filter Definition for the respective documents and the Fields that are to be included in the Result Set can be specified. |
| Target Document Model Element | The first element of the Query Model Tree is always the Target Document Model Element. It specifies the main result of the Query.  The target documents are selected from the database during the Selection phase of Data Service’s query execution. In the following phase, the Projection phase, Data Services will go through the Relationship Model Elements and add the respective linked documents to the results, if the specified Filter Conditions on the Relationships Target Role’s Document Model Element **and** the Filter Condition of the Link Fields Document Model Element are met.  The Document Model Element Editor for the Target Document Model Element shows the query properties `Structure of Result Set (Projection)` and `Exclude All Root Documents`. |
| Relationship Model Element | Additionally to the documents of the Target Document Model Element, further documents can be requested in the query. They will be added to the Result Set in the Projection phase after the target documents are selected from the database during the Selection phase of Data Service’s query execution. Data Services will go through the Relationship Model Elements and add the respective linked documents to the results, if the specified Filter Conditions on the Relationships Target Role’s Document Model Element **and** the Filter Condition of the Link Fields Document Model Element are met. |
