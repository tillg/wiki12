# Form Modeling

This documentation is intended for a business analyst audience.
The Form Model Editor is part of the Simple Model Editor (SME).

## Introduction and Concepts

The Form Model Editor is a modeling tool for defining how data is presented in the User Interface (UI) of business applications.
It is used to organize complex forms and introduces unique ways of creating UI for web applications,
based on underlying Document Models and validation rules.

This manual is intended for analysts and domain experts as a reference for working with the Form Model Editor.

Its contents are structured as follows:

Chapter 1
:   Provides an introduction to Form Modeling. It
    outlines the most important modeling principles and highlights points
    that are common to Document Models as well as Form Models.

Chapter 2
:   Describes all basic functions of the editor—from menus and toolbars
    to the role of different views.

Chapter 3
:   Includes a comprehensive description of all dialogs involved in
    editing online forms with Form Models. After the model’s elements
    and structure have been introduced, every element and its
    corresponding dialogs are described.

### User Interface Models

User Interface (UI) models are essentially construction kits for
typical parts of business applications, such as online forms.

The Form Model Editor facilitates the creation of Form Models, which is one of the UI models.

The Form Model is the most extensive UI model. It is used to lay
out the structure and contents of potentially very complex online
forms. The model contains some simple elements, such as sections and grids,
which are mainly used for organizing the underlying data. Other
elements, such as repeats, are more complex and offer a wide
range of possible configurations.

In business applications, these modeled parts of the UI are
activated by JavaScript engines that interpret these models.
In this case, Form Models are interpreted by the Form Engine.

#### General Structure

A Form Model basically consists of two parts:

1. A header with a set of global model properties, which is called *Meta Data* or
   *Configuration*. Here the model settings are defined. This includes, for example,
   roles and also a reference to the corresponding Document Model file which
   has to be set up in the Document Model Editor beforehand.
2. A content part with the hierarchical list of model elements describes the actual
   structure of the interface part that is being modeled. This is by far
   the most substantial part of a Form Model.

#### Common Properties

All model elements in the Form Model Editor have a name and a label property which can be
set separately for each locale in the case of multilingual models. The [Common Properties for All Model Elements, for Example *New Button Panel* Editor](#fig:chapter01:new-button-panel) shows these properties using the
example of a *New Button Panel* editor.

![add button panel](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/add_button_panel.png)

Figure 1. Common Properties for All Model Elements, for Example *New Button Panel* Editor

Name
:   All elements have a *Name* property which is mandatory. It is used as
    a default label in the Screen view and helps to distinguish the
    different elements. Elements can be referenced by using their name,
    for example, in order to make them conditionally visible or read-only.

Label / Title
:   Many elements have either a label or a title.
    These are multilingual, that is, there is a separate text for each locale configured within the model (see [Model Settings](#txt:editor:settings-view)).
    Expressions can be set as a label/title for most elements (for further information on expressions see [Expressions](#txt:details:expression)).
    The declaration of a label or title is optional.

    For controls and repeat columns, the labels defined in the Document Model for the connected field can be overwritten in the Form Model.
    This can be done either for all controls/columns linked to this field or only for individual controls/columns.
    If no label is given (neither in the Document Model nor in Form Model) then no label will be displayed in the UI.
    The static text labels are also used to replace the placeholders in validation error messages and in the validation bar to identify the controls.
    Labels of type expression are **not** considered for placeholders in validation error messages nor for the jump links in the validation bar.

#### Live Preview

The Form Model Editor provides a preview feature, allowing you to view the results of your model changes as you make them. Once the preview has been opened, it will update automatically as changes are made to the Form Model so that you can see the result of your modeling in real time.

The preview provides a range of functionalities via a menu on the left-hand side, which are documented in [Preview](#txt:editor:preview).

The preview is a powerful tool for testing your models as it includes form navigation, the layout of fields, tables,
buttons and the complete form interaction as well as the business logic from your Document Model.

##### Validation Bar and Correction Screen

A validation bar is displayed in the [Preview](#subsec:preview) above the form if there are any error messages after a full validation of the document.
This allows modelers to test the Kernel based validation of the data entered into the form that is one of the features of the Form Engine.

The validation bar will name the number of errors, warnings, and infos. You can use the quick-access or jump links, provided in the expanded validation message, to
go right away to the issue of the mentioned error, warning or info.

A correction mode is also available and may be accessed by clicking on the quick-access or a provided jump link. [Validation Bar and Correction Screen](#txt:editor:validation) describes this feature in more detail and how the data entered in the Preview may be corrected using this function.

### Form Model

The Form Model Editor pursues a rather abstract but very powerful way of modeling user
interfaces. Instead of diving into design specifics like colors, margins, and spacings, the editor focuses on the organization of UI elements via
models. Instead of letting the user put input fields, radio buttons, or
text labels directly on the screen in a WYSIWYG style, it operates with
hierarchical lists of model elements.

This modeling philosophy enables business experts to focus on their
domain and model complete user interfaces on their own. The following
sections summarize the key principles for working with Form Models.
Generally, the Document Model is defined in the Document Model Editor of the SME, and then later on the user
interface is set up in the Form Model Editor.

#### Reference to Document Model

Each Form Model refers to at least one Document Model. This is a
crucial aspect of understanding the design philosophy of the Form Model Editor. There is
no point in creating Form Models without corresponding Document Models. You
can think of Form Models as a kind of wrapper for selected parts of your
Document Models. They provide the frame for user interaction based on a
selection of your data fields.

Due to this connection, the Document Model and its accompanying validation
rules are usually created first. As soon as this has been done, new UI
models with a reference to this Document Model can be created. The reference
to the Document Model file is set in the global model properties of the
Form Model (see [Model Settings](#txt:editor:settings-view)).

##### Controls

Once a Form Model references a Document Model, its groups and fields are displayed in the Data Models view of the editor. In the process of creating Form Models, data fields are put into the Form Model’s hierarchy via Drag & Drop. The references to data fields in the Form Model’s hierarchy created that way are called *Controls*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Controls are references to *fields*.** You can say that *Control* is kind of a synonym for the field. Controls build the core of each Form Model. The way the user interface model is created is closely linked to the underlying data definitions. Controls are crucial elements of every Form Model. They build the bridge between data and Form Models. There can be any number of Controls by multiple usages of one single data field. If the value of one Control is changed by the user of the resulting application, all Controls which are derived from the corresponding data field are changed as well. |

The visual representation of a Control depends on its underlying data
type and its position in the Form Model’s hierarchy. For example, in Form
Models, primitive data types like *String* or *Number* are typically represented
as input fields. In contrast, the type *Enumeration* can be represented as
a bullet point list or drop-down menu. Furthermore, you have the chance to
create dependencies within Controls (see [Dependent Controls](#subsec:details:dependent-control)).

##### Repeats

Repeats are special structures that facilitate the creation of
repeatable Sections which are based on repeatable groups in the Document Model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In case there are several repeats bound to the same group, for each of them, an empty data set will be created whenever a data set is added to any of the repeats. |

For further details on repeats, refer to [Repeats](#txt:form:repeats).

#### Form Model Elements

A *Form Model* is created by arranging a list of model elements. You can create an element by right-clicking in the Screen view and selecting an element from the context menu. For every Form Model, there are restrictions regarding the
model hierarchy. Some elements can be placed inside other elements.
Others do not, as you can see in [Element hierarchy](#table:element-hierarchy).

Table 1. Element hierarchy


| **Model Element** | **Allowed Sub-Elements** |
| --- | --- |
| [Screen](#txt:intro:screen) | Section, Control Grid, Button Panel, Detached Repeat, Embedded Repeat, Inline Repeat, Custom Screen Element |
| [Section](#txt:intro:section) | Section, Control Grid, Button Panel, Detached Repeat, Embedded Repeat, Inline Repeat, Custom Screen Element |
| [Multi-Column Section](#txt:intro:multi-column-section) | Section, Control Grid, Button Panel, Detached Repeat, Embedded Repeat, Inline Repeat, Custom Screen Element |
| [Control Grid](#txt:intro:control-grid) | Row |
| [Row](#txt:intro:row) | Control, Text Cell, Expression Cell, Custom Cell |
| [Button Panel](#txt:intro:button-panel) | Button |
| [Detached Repeat](#txt:intro:detached-repeat) | Screen |
| [Embedded Repeat](#txt:intro:embedded-repeat) | Control Grid |
| [Inline Repeat](#txt:intro:inline-repeat) | - |
| [Custom Screen Element](#txt:intro:custom-screen-element) | Custom code from a developer |
| [Control](#txt:intro:control) | - |
| [Text Cell](#txt:intro:text) | - |
| [Expression Cell](#txt:intro:expression-cell) | - |
| [Custom Cell](#txt:intro:custom-cell) | Custom code from a developer |
| [Button](#txt:intro:button) | - |

The *Screen* element functions as the root element. Screens are usually managed in the *Screens View*, but there is one exception: The *Detached Repeat* also includes an additional Screen. *Controls*, *Text Cells*, *Expression Cells* and *Buttons* are the innermost elements of the hierarchy. They cannot contain other elements.

*Sections* are the only elements that can be nested inside one another. However, it is indirectly possible to nest Repeats. Since for each Detached Repeat a Screen element is automatically created, it is possible to add another Repeat to that Screen, producing a stack of nested Repeats.

![nested repeats](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/nested-repeats.png)

Figure 2. Nested Repeats

Controls are typically the lowest-level nodes in the hierarchy. This is
why you can think of the remaining UI elements as a kind of wrapper or
frame for Controls and eventually data fields.

##### Screen

A form can consist of multiple Screens. A Screen is a sub-part of a complex form that is visible at a given time. Scrolling might be necessary to access all elements of the Screen. When setting up a Form Model, different navigation styles can be defined. It can be decided whether Screens are rendered as individual parts, which are connected by navigation buttons mostly in the form of "Previous / Next" to support a Screen wizard process or whether a tab navigation style should be applied.

The label that can be defined for a Screen is used as fallback label for Navigation Buttons which have this Screen as target and do not have a label themselves.

See [Screen](#txt:detail:screen) for more detailed information on the modeling settings.

##### Section

Sections, also called *Groups*, help to group several Control Grids and give them a common headline. This is an optional element between the Screen level and Control Grid level which is useful for ordering complex forms by describing the context of the Controls elements contained.

The modeling setting for Sections are described in [Section](#txt:detail:section).

##### Multi-Column Section

A Multi-Column Section is also used to group Control fields but in a horizontal manner. Up to four forms can be displayed horizontally next to each other.

For more information, see [Multi-Column Section](#txt:detail:multi-column-section).

##### Control Grid

A Control Grid is the container for Controls and different types of Cells. A Control is never placed directly on a Screen - it always has to be placed inside a Control Grid to define its position, for example, in a multi-column grid. A Control Grid is organized by columns and rows. A Control is always positioned in one cell, defined by column and row, thus all Controls have their exact positions within a grid and their alignment is controlled automatically.

Control Grids are described in detail in [Control Grid](#txt:detail:control-grid).

##### Row

A row is a helper element for multi-columned Control Grids. Each row has a label of its own which can be filled out optionally. See [Row](#txt:detail:row) for more information.

##### Button Panel

A `Button Panel` basically is a container for Buttons. While the buttons defined via `Settings > Subheader and Footer` are available for all Screens of the form, the `Button Panel` introduces additional ways for precisely placing buttons in sections of specific Screens.

##### Detached Repeat

Represents a repeatable Section that is modeled on a separate Screen.
When entering data into a Detached Repeat, only the single set of data
that is currently edited is visible on the Screen. When entering the
data for the Detached Repeat has been finished, the selected content of this
additional Screen can be displayed as an overview within the enclosing
Screen in a table-like fashion.

The modeling settings for Detached Repeats are described in [Detached Repeat](#subsec:details:detached-repeat).

##### Embedded Repeat

Represents a hybrid of both Inline and Detached Repeat. The data sets
can all be viewed in an overview table at the same time. However, when
editing a single set of data an editable row is opened to display all
the necessary Controls to edit that specific set.

Embedded Repeats are described in detail in [Embedded Repeat](#subsec:details:Embedded-repeat).

##### Inline Repeat

Represents a repeatable Section where all data entries are directly
visible within the enclosing Screen. So multiple sets of data can be
seen simultaneously in the [Preview](#subsec:preview).

You can find more information on Inline Repeats in [Inline Repeat](#subsec:details:inline-repeat).

##### Custom Screen Element

A `Custom Element` basically is a container that is used as a placeholder. This is useful when the modeler comes up against the limits of modeling, since they can still build their model and a developer can insert a customized element at this point. The Form Model Editor provides a `CustomScreenElement` which can be added to `Sections` and `Screens`. Refer to the [Form Engine](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html) documentation for a detailed instruction on how to create a customized element.

##### Control

Controls are references to fields of the Document Model. For example, they can be defined in the form of text input fields or
drop-down lists. For more information about Controls in general, see
[Controls](#txt:intro:fields-controls). A detailed
description of Controls in forms can be found
[here](#txt:detail:control).

##### Text Cell

Using text elements, additional explanations and notes can be
placed in Control Grids. They will be rendered read-only as described in [Text Cell](#txt:detail:text).

##### Expression Cell

Expression Cells allow static text to be combined with data from data fields. The output may also be formatted. Expression Cells can be
placed in Control Grids and will be rendered read-only. Expressions are described in more detail in [Expressions](#txt:details:expression).

##### Custom Cell

A `CustomCell` basically is a container that is used as a placeholder. This is useful when the modeler comes up against the limits of modeling, since they can still build their model and a developer can insert a customized element at this point. `CustomCells`. can be added to `Rows` inside a `ControlGrid`. Refer to the [Form Engine](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html) documentation for a detailed instruction on how to create a customized element.

##### Button

Buttons can be positioned within `Button Panels` to be shown in the content of a specific Screen. They also can be placed in the subheader or footer region of a single Screen or via the model settings for all Screens.
They trigger actions and are associated with events.

Buttons accessible in the subheader or the footer of a form can be defined either via `Screen > Subheader and Footer` or via
`Settings > Subheader and Footer`.

For more details refer to [Button](#txt:detail:button).

#### Dependencies

Dependencies are configurational elements which are set up in the
`Data Configuration View`. They are applied to the
underlying fields and groups of the Document Model.

* **Dependent Field**
  Based on the value of a master field, the dependent field can be read-only, not relevant or set to a specific value.
* **Dependent Group**
  Based on the value of a master field, all fields of a group can be read-only or not relevant.
* **Dependent Enumeration**
  Allows you to filter subsets of an enumeration according to the prefixes
  of its enumeration values.

For further details on dependencies, refer to [Dependencies](#txt:form:dependencies).

#### Plasma Design

The graphical finish of the UI elements that have been modeled is
completely decoupled. In order to provide an attractive and modern
design out of the box, A12 makes use of [Plasma Design](https://geta12.com/docs/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/index.html) - a coherent
design concept for business applications developed by mgm.

In order to get the most out of the predefined style definitions, we
recommend a set of best practices for every Form Model. Refer to the
UI/UX documentation for designing forms in compliance with Plasma Design.

In addition to the default design, individual customizing can be done by
web designers who may adapt the CSS of the output generated by the Form Model Editor.

### Interlocking Between Document Models and Form Models

Data and validation definitions are modeled in different, separate models from models that describe the UI.
This strict separation provides a high
degree of flexibility. Document Models and Form Models can be created by
different people for example. Several Form Models can be created based on
the same Document Model. There are however some points of contact where
both modeling areas - data/validation and UI - interlock with each
other.

The most prominent point of contact is the bridge from data fields to UI
Controls (see [Controls](#txt:intro:fields-controls)). In addition to
this crucial concept, there are further areas where you need to be aware
of connections between data, validation, and UI definitions.

#### Text and Labels

Some texts are defined in the Document Model exclusively because they are strongly
linked to data and validation definitions. These include labels of
enumeration elements and text messages for validation errors. Other
labels like headlines can only be specified in the Form Model. Some labels can be
defined in both tools for convenience reasons. In that case, labels
defined in the Form Model will override the labels set in the Document Model (see [General Structure](#txt:intro:model-structure)).
The following table summarizes by which tool each kind of text or label
can be specified:

| **Type of Label** | **Document Model** | **Form Model** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field/Control labels |  |  |
| Field configuration labels |  |  |
| Internal field description |  |  |
| Hints |  |  |
| Headlines |  |  |
| Enumeration Texts |  |  |
| Validation Error Texts |  |  |
| Helper Texts |  |  |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For field labels and hints, the default text is defined in the Document Model . If you "drag and drop" a data field into the Screen view of the Form Model Editor you do not have to specify the label text each time, because the default label text from the Document Model is being used automatically. You may, however, overwrite field labels and hints in the Form Model Editor. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Helper texts are not shown for inputs inside Inline Repeat tables. You can use the hints as an additional source of information. |

#### Aspects of Multilingualism

All texts and labels can be defined for multiple locales. There is no
restriction on the number of locales. It is not required to configure a locale.
One way to set up multilingual user interfaces is to configure the
desired locales configured in the Document Model and the Form Model.
In every model, the locale specification is part of the global model properties also known as the model header.

Which locales are used by Form Models is configured in the [Model Settings](#txt:editor:settings-view).

Refer to the Document Modeling documentation for a description of how to configure multilingual Document Models.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can easily set every multilingual element. It is convenient to do because all elements get additional entry fields for each locale except expressions (read [Expressions](#txt:details:expression) for more details). In the [Preview](#subsec:preview) only English and German are supported. |

![multilinguality](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/multilinguality.png)

Figure 3. Multilingual Configuration Example for Labels and Buttons

#### Repeats in Forms

Some features of the Form Model Editor can only be used if the underlying Document Model meets
certain criteria. A prominent example is the use of repeats
in forms. You cannot drag & drop any field from the field view into
a repeatable element in the Screen view. This is only possible for
fields that have been created within repeatable groups in the Document Model .

#### Enumerations for Dependencies

The Form Model Editor enables users to define dependencies between fields and groups.
Based on the values of a master field, dependent fields or groups can be
read-only or not relevant for example. Only enumerations and boolean
fields are allowed to be the master fields for dependencies. The trigger
values are defined in the Document Model .

## Basic Editor Functions

This chapter describes the layout and basic functionalities of the Form Model Editor. It
first presents [How to Add a New Form Model](#txt:editor:new-model) before providing an overview of the editor’s different views in [Editor Overview](#txt:editor:overview). Then, it explains all menus and their commands.

Detailed information about dialogs for specific model elements is
provided in the next chapter.

### Adding a New Form Model

To add a new Form Model, click the `Add` button at the top of the Workspace Explorer View and select `Form Model`. An *Add Form Model* dialog opens, with features explained in [Add Form Model Dialog Features](#tab:chapter03:add-form-model).

These settings may be changed after the new `Form Model` is created.
The Name, `Document Model`, Locales, and Roles can be changed in the [Model Settings](#txt:editor:settings-view), and the folder may be changed in the Workspace Explorer via drag and drop.

![add form model dialog](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/add-form-model-dialog.png)

Figure 4. Add Form Model Dialog

Table 2. Add Form Model Dialog Features


| Feature | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Folder** | Yes | A list which allows you to select a root directory. |
| **Name** | Yes | The name of the Form Model. |
| **Document Model** | Yes | A list which allows you to specify the referenced Document Model with the underlying data. See [Settings](#txt:form:model-settings-tab1) for more details. |
| **Build Screens From Fields** | No | This action creates default Screens for  all fields in the referenced Document Model which then can be used as a starting point for refining the Form Model. |
| **Locales** | No | See [Settings](#txt:form:model-settings-tab1) |
| **Roles** | Yes/No | Required if and only if the Workspace contains a role model. See [Settings](#txt:form:model-settings-tab1) |

### Overview

The Form Model Editor is an application for creating, editing, and examining Form Models. The editor is divided into several parts that are highlighted in [A12 Form Model Editor inside the SME](#fig:fmm-views):

1. **Workspace Explorer View**
   Explorer for browsing and selecting a model that is to be edited. The view lists all A12 models available in the project folder and its subfolders.
2. **Form Model View**
   Main view containing a sidebar, the Screens, Settings, Data Configuration and Problems View.
3. **Data Models View**
   Contains on top a list of Relationship Models related to the underlying Document Model. These can be dragged into the Screen View to create new Bindings.

   Below the content, that is, the groups and fields, of the referenced Document Model are listed.

   The Data Models View is automatically collapsed when opening the settings or an element editor, but can be expanded again if needed, for example, for defining expressions.
4. **Sidebar**
   Sidebar to navigate through the Form Model Editor and to save or cancel editing the opened Form Model.
5. **Screen View**
   Main editing window for creating and modifying hierarchies of model elements. New elements are created using the context menu or through drag and drop of elements from the Data Models View.
6. **Problems View**
   Displays problems that may occur during modeling, for example, if a field is referenced in the Form Model that no longer exists in the Document Model.

![fmm views](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/fmm-views.png)

Figure 5. A12 Form Model Editor inside the SME

### Form Model View

The Form Model View is the overall view, which by default displays the Screens View after a Form Model is opened. On the left is a sidebar that can be used to navigate between the different views and to use features such as opening the live [Preview](#subsec:preview).

#### Sidebar

In the sidebar of the Form Model Editor, the name of the Form Model is displayed in the top. The following menus, views and features can be accessed:

* Screens
* Settings
* Data Configuration
* Problems
* Preview

Below the menus, the following buttons are available:

* Deploy
* Cancel
* Save As
* Save

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is possible to save an invalid Form Model, for example, to save an invalid "work in progress" state of a model. Use this with care. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Opening a Form Model with an invalid Document Model Reference will open the Form Model directly in the Settings View showing validation errors to the user. |

#### Screens View

The `Screens View` is the area of the Form Model Editor where most of the work on Form Models is done. Here you can set up all model elements and Controls. Depending on the model type you are working on, different rows are displayed and different model elements become available.

A model element can be added to the list by opening the context menu with a right-click on the corresponding row or with a left-click on the three vertical dots (hamburger menu or ellipsis) and then selecting the desired element. Controls are created by dragging fields from the Document Model Content shown in the `Data Models View` into the `Screens View`. By default, the Control label is taken over from the Document Model set up in the Document Model Editor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The structure of each Form Model has to meet certain criteria. This structure determines, in which way model elements can be placed on the `Screens View`. The rules and restrictions about building the hierarchy of model elements are described in [Form Model Elements](#txt:forms:model_elements:structure). |

##### Context Menu

In [Context Menu in `Screens View`](#fig:screen-view-context) we see an example Screen named *Screen1* and its corresponding context menu.

![context menu](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/context-menu.png)

Figure 6. Context Menu in `Screens View`

The context menu lists the elements of the respective model which is edited. In addition to the model elements,
there are some menu items that are available for every Form Model:

* **Cut/Copy:** Cuts/Copies a model element. This action is only enabled when you
  select an element from the Screen’s view that is allowed to be cut/copied.
* **Paste:** Pastes a model element from the clipboard into the Screen
  view.
* **Delete :** Deletes the selected model element or Control. This cannot be
  undone.

##### Cut / Copy & Paste

The Form Model Editor allows you to cut or copy and paste elements within the Screens View. You
can either use the corresponding menu items from the context
menu or the well-known keyboard shortcuts `Cmd/Win+X`, `Cmd/Win+C`, and `Cmd/Win+V`. The Form Model Editor maintains its own clipboard for that purpose.

##### Drag & Drop

The Form Model Editor provides a drag-and-drop mechanism for utilizing the fields of the
Document Model within the Form Model. In addition, you can use a drag-and-drop
mechanism to simply restructure the existing model elements within the
`Screens View` itself.

##### Search Elements

The `Screens View` displays all modeled Screens along with their respective elements by default. To facilitate navigation within large Form Models, you can use the search box above the Form Model tree to locate specific elements.

When you enter a search term, the Form Model tree automatically filters to show only those elements that contain the search term as a substring, along with their parent items. By default the search compares the search term to the names of the elements. However, this can be adjusted by clicking on the settings icon inside the search bar. This opens up the following dialog, where you can choose to search by label or ID instead.

![search settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/search-settings.png)

Figure 7. Search settings

Note:

* When searching for a label of a field, it is important to keep in mind that the label specified on the control has precedence over the label of the field configuration. The label of the field configuration has precedence over the label specified in the Document Model.
* Labels are searched by all of the specified locales
* Expression labels cannot be searched

###### Debugging with IDs

When an error is reported in an application, for example in the Preview Application or Form Model Preview, the message often includes an element ID. Ensure Search by ID is enabled in the Form Model tree and then copy the ID from the error. Paste the ID into the Form Model tree search to locate the offending element and inspect or fix its configuration.
If an element has no meaningful label or name, enable `Show Empty Labels` in the Form Model Preview to retrieve its ID and use it together with the ID search for faster, reliable debugging.

##### Show Elements

As an alternative method for navigating large Form Models, you can choose to display only specific elements and hide the rest.

To configure which elements are shown, click the button located next to the search input above the Form Model tree. This opens a dialog listing all top-level Screens, as well as filterable element types within the Form Model (see ['Show Elements' Dialog in the Screens View](#fig:screen-view-show-elements)).

For each element in the list, you can select whether it should be displayed or hidden. For Controls and Field Columns, it is possible to filter for specific field types.

As soon as Form Model elements are filtered, elements that are not filterable are hidden as well.

Additionally, for Screens, you can quickly bring a selected Screen into view by clicking the button at the end of its corresponding row.

![fmm show elements](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/fmm-show-elements.png)

Figure 8. 'Show Elements' Dialog in the Screens View

#### Settings View

The `Settings View` is to configure settings for the current Form Model file. You can enter this view by clicking the
`Settings` tab from the sidebar inside the `Form Model View`.

The `Settings View` contains the tabs and corresponding fields that can be found in the following sections
[Settings](#txt:form:model-settings-tab1), [Repeat Default Button Labels](#txt:form:model-settings-tab2) and [Subheader and Footer](#txt:form:model-settings-tab3).

![model settings view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/model-settings-view.png)

Figure 9. Model Settings View

##### Settings

Name
:   The name of the model.

Model Version
:   The version of the model.

Description
:   A description of the model, for example, its purpose, editing history, etc.

###### General Settings

Document Model
:   Name of the Document Model file. The path shown in the drop-down depends on the folders that are shown in the Workspace Explorer.

Amount Suffix
:   The global suffix, will be used for Controls and repeat columns based on number fields from the Document Model, which have the unit 'amount'. This could be used, for example, to set a default currency suffix. The suffix can be overwritten per referenced number field in the control / repeat column settings.

    * Static: An arbitrary string value may be entered.
    * Dynamic: The localized value of the referenced enumeration field will be used.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | This enumeration field must be non-repeatable! |

Readonly Presentation
:   Defines the read-only presentation for Controls inside the model.
    You can also define the read-only presentation for a Control Grid or Control, which will override the read-only presentation defined here.

    * Input: Controls that are readonly will be rendered as a read-only input field
    * Text Output: Controls that are readonly will be rendered as plain text

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Inline Repeats are not affected as they have a separate setting (see [Readonly Presentation](#inline-repeat-readonly-presentation)). |

Show Asterisks
:   Depending on the setting, asterisks will be shown on labels of Controls and Field Overview Columns. You can also define it on individual Controls and Field Overview Columns, in which case
    this general setting overrides it, unless kept on default (*If required*).

    * If required: Asterisks will only be shown for required fields.
    * Never: Asterisks will never be shown.
    * Always: Asterisks will be shown on every label, regardless of the required status of the referenced field.
      They will not be shown for readonly, disabled or computed fields.

###### General Detached Repeat Settings

No data change in Detail Screen
:   This option defines how the commit button of Detached Repeat Detail Screens should be displayed if no data changed in the Detail Screen yet.

    * Disable Button: Show a disabled commit button as long as the data did not change on the Screen,
    * Hide Button: Hide the commit button.
    * Show enabled Button (default value): The commit button will always be shown and enabled.

      If one of these options is selected, the button will be enabled/shown as soon as the user entered some input in any of the Controls on the Screen and leaves the current Control.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | Once the button is enabled/shown on this Detail Screen it will not be disabled/hidden again as long as the user is on this Detail Screen.  Reverting changes by changing the input values back to the previous state will not disable/hide the button. |

###### General Inline Repeat Settings

Readonly Presentation
:   Defines the read-only presentation for field overview columns in Inline Repeats.
    You can also define the read-only presentation for a specific Inline Repeat or a column, which will overwrite the read-only presentation defined here.

    * Input: Columns that are read-only will be rendered as a read-only input field
    * Text Output: Columns that are readonly will be rendered as plain text.

###### Rule Confirmation Settings

Disable Rule Confirmation Dialog
:   Configures whether a confirmation dialog is shown for warning and information rules.

    * always show confirmation: Default, confirmation is enabled for all messages of level "info" and "warning"
    * info only: confirmation is disabled only for messages of level "info"
    * info and warning: confirmation is disabled for all messages of level "info" and "warning"

Show Confirmation Summary
:   Configures whether the summary inside the confirmation dialog is shown

![warning info confirmation modal](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/warning-info-confirmation-modal.png)

Figure 10. Confirmation Dialog With Confirmation Summary

###### Preprocessing Settings

The following options allow influencing the preprocessing behavior when opening documents in the Form Engine.

Preprocessing when opening a new document
:   Configures the preprocessing behavior which is applied to a new document after the initial values and rows have been filled out.

    * no preprocessing: neither computations nor any dependencies with value effects are evaluated
    * evaluate computations (default): only the computations defined in the document model are executed. The computation results will not trigger dependencies with value effects.
    * evaluate computations and dependencies: computations and dependencies are evaluated together. The evaluation starts with the dependencies triggered by the initial values.

Preprocessing when opening an existing document
:   Configures the preprocessing behavior which is applied when a preexisting document is opened.

    * no preprocessing (default): neither computations nor any dependencies with value effects are evaluated
    * evaluate computations: only the computations defined in the document model are executed. The computation results will not trigger dependencies with value effects.
    * evaluate computations and dependencies: computations and dependencies are evaluated together.

      For existing documents, the evaluation starts with computations. Dependencies are only evaluated as long as the evaluation starts with a trigger change resulting from a computation. Be cautious, as this could lead to overwriting dependent values that have been manually changed before saving.

      On the other side, dependencies, which do not have a trigger that is changed due to a computation, are not evaluated. Such triggers can only be considered unchanged and thus, dependent values are not rewritten.

      Mind that for existing documents the last two options can lead to the form already containing unsaved changes on opening.

Note that for both preprocessing options the display state effects defined in dependencies (for example, readonly, hidden since not relevant) are always applied directly, independent from the respective setting and only based on the values in the document. See also [Dependency Evaluation](#txt:details:dependency-evaluation) for reference.

When opening the preview or when clicking the reset button in the preview, the document is preprocessed according to the 'new document' setting. When importing an existing document from a workspace data file, it is preprocessed according to the 'existing document' setting.

###### CDM Specific Preprocessing Defaults

The default behavior when opening existing CDM based documents differs from the default behavior for regular non-CDM documents: Computations are always evaluated.
Thus, for Form Models based on a Composed Document Model (CDM) the default option in the setting for opening an existing document is evaluating computations.

The Form Model Editor Preview doesn’t support CDM based documents. When a default value in a CDM based Form Model was set, it behaves according to the default behavior of a regular Form Model.

###### Locales

This shows the list of locales for locale-specific labels.
New locales may be added to the list using the "Add" button at the bottom of the list or removed using the "Delete" button at the end of each row.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Enter "en", "de", "fr" and "nl" to the list if you want to enter texts in English, German, French, and Dutch language.  If you want to specify texts using more fine-granular locale level, you can differentiate further by entering for example: "en", "de", "en\_GB", "en\_US", "de\_DE" and "de\_AT". |

The editor will offer a separate input field for every given locale
whenever multilingual inputs are possible, for example, for labels, titles
etc.

###### Labels

Heading of the form’s content box. If no label is provided, the heading will be empty.

###### Subtitle

Subtitle below the heading of the form’s content box. Can also be an expression.

###### Styles

The Form Model Editor allows you to use custom CSS styles for each model element (with the
exception of the screen element of a Detached Repeat). The styles that you add to this list can then be added to Form Model elements using the editors in the Screens view. [Edit Styles Globally in Model Settings](#fig:melies-edit-model-style) shows an example for which three different style values are defined.

![styles in model settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/styles-in-model-settings.png)

Figure 11. Edit Styles Globally in Model Settings

These styles can then be applied to all model elements by open its editor, expanding the *Styles* section and select from the drop-down menu. [Edit Styles for a Control](#fig:melies-edit-field-style) displays the edit dialog for applying custom styles to a Control.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | By default, the label and cursor position of number Controls are right aligned. If you apply your own style, this default style will not be set. In case you still want the Control to be right aligned you need to apply the helper class `h_rightAlign` as well. |

![styles on element](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/styles-on-element.png)

Figure 12. Edit Styles for a Control

The selected styles for a model element are passed to the corresponding widget through the className property.
The following table lists all model elements, which can have styles assigned to them, and the respective widgets,
that these styles will be applied (see [A12 Widgets Documentation](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/basics/helper-classes)).

| Form Model Element | Widget |
| --- | --- |
| ButtonPanel | ButtonGroup |
| EventButton | Button |
| NavigationButton in Subheader | MenuItem |
| other NavigationButton | Button |
| ControlGrid | LayoutGrid.Grid |
| ControlGrid Row | LayoutGrid.Row |
| Control, TextCell, ExpressionCell | LayoutGrid.Column |
| Section | Typography.Section |
| MultiColumnSection | LayoutGrid.Grid |
| Repeat | wrapper div data-role="repeat-(detached/embedded/inline)" |
| FieldColumn, ExpressionColumn | Table BodyCell |
| RowAction | Button |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is no automated Form Model migration for the mapping of styles to the respective widgets. If there are breaking changes that affect the used widgets or helper classes, they will be documented in the corresponding tickets. The styles in affected models will have to be adapted manually. |

###### Roles

The roles that you can assign to your model are taken from a YAML file in the Workspace.

If you have created your Workspace using the Preview App Control, this file is in the "user" folder and is called "access-rights.yaml".

If no valid YAML file is visible to the SME, then the drop-down will be blank and the assignment of roles is optional.

###### Annotations

You can apply Annotations to the Form Model so that the resulting application can access those Annotations and can use them
within the custom implementation.
For example, an Annotation can be used to show all fields that have this Annotation in boldface.

A list of Annotations as name/value pairs for this form can be modeled.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Annotations can also be added to Form Model elements in the [model element editors](#txt:detail:annotations) and Document Model elements in the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view). |

##### Repeat Default Button Labels

The default button labels may be changed for each Locale for the following buttons:

* Add
* CommitAdd
* Apply
* Edit
* Remove
* View
* Cancel
* Confirm
* Return
* Up
* Down
* Copy
* Close
* Download
* Skip
* Replace
* Upload as Copy
* Remove Confirmation Title
* Remove Confirmation Message

##### Subheader and Footer

Global Form Model buttons can be created four different areas by adding them to the following lists:

* Subheader Minor Buttons
* Subheader Major Buttons
* Footer Minor Buttons
* Footer Major Buttons

#### Data Configuration View

With the Data Configuration View comes the possibility to set, edit or delete configurational elements such as dependencies. Accordingly, the fields of the Document Model are displayed in this view. Fields that are part of a dependency are marked with colored flags (see [`Data Configuration View` With Trigger and Dependent Flags](#fig:data-configuration-view)). A distinction is made between `Trigger` and `Dependent` flags. A field that is both a trigger and a dependent gets both flags. Multiple flags of the same type are clustered with a counter. Hovering the flags will display a list of all fields that have a dependency linked to this field.

![dependency flags](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/dependency-flags.png)

Figure 13. `Data Configuration View` With Trigger and Dependent Flags

#### Problems View

This view lists all kinds of problems that may occur during the Form Model
creation process. For each problem encountered the following properties are displayed, telling
where and when the problem came up.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Problem View only becomes visible when you click on the problems tab in the sidebar of the Form Model View. |

![problems view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/problems-view.png)

Figure 14. `Problems View`

There is no context menu for the `Problems View`.

#### Preview

Clicking the preview button in the sidebar will open a new window displaying a Form Engine that renders the current Form Model.

![preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/preview.png)

Figure 15. Live Preview of the Form

Every time you now make a valid change, the preview window will update automatically. Reloading the page is not required for changes which do not influence the preview document.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When the preview updates, the existing UI State is reused as long as all screens are still available in the Form Model. If this is not the case, the UI state will be reset to the default. The entered data is kept regardless. Because of this behavior, certain updates in the Form Model Editor might introduce visual inconsistencies in the preview, for example, removing the `sortable` property from a column while the repeat is currently sorted by this column. In these cases, a manual reload of the preview (by either reloading the page directly, using the sidebar button or closing and reopening it via the SME) is required. |

Cases in which a reload is required to see the effect:

* changing the number initial rows of an Inline Repeat
* changing the initial value of a Control

The menu on the left-hand side of the preview provides the following functionality.

| Name | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| `Screens` | Navigating to Screens if there is more than one Screen available. |
| `Validate` | Checking rules and validation. See [Validation Bar and Correction Screen](#txt:editor:validation) for more details. |
| `Reset` | Reset to the initial state of the form (for example, removes entered data, clears validation messages and navigates back to the initial screen). A Confirmation Dialog is displayed, giving the user the option to cancel the action. |
| `Width` | Setting the width of the Form Engine to large, medium, small or extra small. This allows for convenient modeling of responsive layouts. |
| `Theme Selector` | Setting one of the available themes of Widgets (default, compact, flat and flat compact), which is then saved in the local storage. This means that the selected theme will be remembered even if you close the Form Model Editor. Additionally, Themes which are available in your workspace (within the folder `resources/themes`) can be selected here. A custom workspace theme though will not be remembered after closing the Form Model Editor and must be manually selected again. |
| `Locale` | Changing the displayed locale, which can be defined in the Form [Model Settings](#txt:editor:settings-view). For more details, refer to [Settings](#txt:form:model-settings-tab1). |
| `Readonly` | Displaying elements in read-only mode. |
| `Hide / Show Empty Labels` | Showing or hiding generated labels where no label was assigned in the Form Model . |
| `Data` | Save data as Workspace Data files to your workspace via `Data > Save`. The current state of the document is saved in the same file it was loaded from. For a new document, it will be created with a randomly generated filename within the `data/documents` directory. If present, the respective attachments are saved and referenced in the document.  Showing raw data in JSON format in a detail view next to the form via `Data > Show data`.  Display data from matching Workspace Data Documents offered via `Data > Documents`. |
| `NOW Value` | Changing/Setting `NOW`. In some models, Rule Conditions are checked against [NOW or TODAY](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#Heutep), for example, to prevent deliveries before certain deadlines. To test such rules in advance, it must be possible to set NOW to a value in the future. Note: TODAY is implicitly determined by NOW. To avoid inconsistencies, only NOW can be specified on the interface. |
| `Custom Conditions` | Specifying the return value "true" or "false" for `Custom Conditions`. A dialog can be opened using the sidebar for this purpose. The dialog has a table with the two columns "Name of CustomCondition" and "Return value". The names of the CustomConditions specified in the DM can be queried through the meta interface of the generated code - they are listed in the first column of the table. The column "Return value" initially contains the value "false" for all CustomConditions and can be changed to "true" if required. The default value "false" is selected so that CustomConditions do not report errors by default. This is the desired behavior especially for "Form Engine Preview" in Form Model Editor and a deviation from this in Ad Hoc Test would be confusing. The Ad Hoc test is intended as a tool for the business analyst to check their modeling. The CustomCondition, on the other hand, must be implemented by a developer in the project and can and should be unit tested there. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The data entered in the preview is lost if the preview is reloaded. For example when leaving the Form Model Editor, changing the Document Model and then switching back. There is a risk that the Document Model no longer fits the document of the entered data. For this reason, the document is reinitialized. At this point, the preview user is encouraged to use workspace data. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Mind that forms with data represent documents. All entered data is validated. But in some specific error cases, this can prevent storing the data in the document. Formally incorrect data in certain fields, for example, letters in a number field or a wrong date format, will not get stored. |

In addition to the width menu functionality, the preview itself behaves responsively. This means when shrinking the browser window, using the responsive dev tools, or working with mobile devices the form will adapt, and scroll bars and a button to open or close the side menu will appear.

![preview responsive](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/preview-responsive.png)

Figure 16. Minimized Preview

The model including a preview can easily be shared cross-computer
because you do not need any further project template files.

The preview includes form navigation, the layout of fields, tables and
buttons and the complete form interaction as well as business logic.

##### Validation Bar and Correction Screen

The *Validate* button from the sidebar of the [Preview](#txt:editor:preview) will execute a
full validation of all rules existing in the model. A full validation
for customer (live) models is triggered if a button with validation mode *full* will be clicked.

A validation bar is displayed above the form if there are any error messages after a full validation of the document. If only parts of the document are validated, for example, via a button with validation mode *partial*, the validation bar will not be triggered.

The validation bar will name the number of errors, warnings, and infos. You can use the quick-access or jump links, provided in the expanded validation message, to
go right away to the issue of the mentioned error, warning or info.

You will enter the correction mode if you jump to one of the issues using the quick-access or a provided jump link. The following limitations exist while the form is in correction mode:

* You cannot add or delete a row of a repeat.
* You cannot use the navigation buttons.

![errors warnings infos in form](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/errors-warnings-infos-in-form.png)

Figure 17. Errors, Warnings, and Infos in Form

The *Exit correction Mode* button will close the correction mode and
goes back to the form.
The *Validate* button will execute a full validation again.

Or you can use a menu from the validation bar with other options.

![validationBar collapsed](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/validationBar-collapsed.png)

Figure 18. Validation Bar Collapsed With Menu

Errors, warnings and infos are displayed in different colors and with different
icons. Errors are red, warnings are orange and infos are blue.

![validationBar expanded](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/validationBar-expanded.png)

Figure 19. Validation Bar Expanded

"Show All Issues" will list all errors, warnings and infos together within the Correction Screen.

![validationBar allissues](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter01/validationBar-allissues.png)

Figure 20. List With References to All Fields

The list provides links to all issues. These
links will redirect you to the fields in the form where you can make
corrections.

Clicking *Back* in the header will close the entire Correction Screen and
your form will be shown again.

### Data Models View

The `Data Models View` shown in [Data Models View](#fig:data-models-view) has two parts. In the upper section, all Relationship Models related to the referenced Document Model are listed. The lower section shows all groups and fields of the referenced Document Model.

The elements from both sections can be dropped to the Screens of the Form Model in order to create new Form Model elements as explained in [Drag & Drop](#txt:editor:drag-and-drop).

![data models view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter02/data-models-view.png)

Figure 21. Data Models View

### Refactoring Support

For a general description of the refactoring feature, see the [Refactoring Support](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-ba-docs/index.html#_refactoring_support) documentation. The following tables show what action triggers a refactoring and what properties might be affected.

#### Within the Model

| Action | Affected Properties |
| --- | --- |
| Deletion of a Screen | Target Screen in Navigation Buttons |
| Deletion of a Repeat Column | Initial Sorting Column in the same Repeat |
| Deletion of a Screen Element | Trigger Element for Dependent Controls |
| Deletion of a Control | Focused Element For Initial Rendering in a Screen |
| Deletion of a Style | Styles in all Elements |
| Renaming/Deletion of a Row Action | Default Row Action in the same Repeat |

#### Across Models

| Action | Affected Properties |
| --- | --- |
| Deletion of a Field | Trigger Element for Dependent Fields and Dependent Groups |
| Deletion of a Enum Field | Dynamic Amount Suffix in the Model Settings, Trigger Element for Dependent Enumeration |
| Renaming a Document Model | Document Model in the Model Settings |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Deleting a referenced Document Model (or one of their Includes) is deemed unrecoverable and is not covered by the Refactoring Support. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Field references in Expressions (Filter Expressions, Expression Labels, Expressions Cells) cannot always safely be refactored. To avoid changing those occurrences in an unintended way and thus breaking business logic, they are not refactored at all. |

## Editors for Model Elements

Forms are the heart of document-oriented business applications. The
Form Model provides the means to create and manage complex forms with up
to thousands of fields, dependencies, and repeatable sections.

The following sections describe the model’s elements, structure, and modeling settings.

### Common Features

Several settings are available on nearly all Model Element Editors in the Form Model Editor. For example:

Name
:   You must assign a name to all elements in the Form Model except for rows.
    The names of sibling elements must be unique.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Rows that do not have a name are displayed as "<Row>" in the Form Model Tree. This applies to Rows that are:  * Automatically generated when Controls are added to a Control Grid. * Manually created and unnamed. |

#### Label

Type
:   * **Text**:
      A list showing the different locales is displayed under the drop-down to allow multilingual labels to be modeled.
    * **Expression**:
      An expression may be added in the editor below this drop-down. See [Expressions](#txt:details:expression) for more details.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Button labels are displayed in capital letters. |

#### Hide Condition

The Hide Condition section available in the editor of most Form Model elements allows you to configure the element to be conditionally hidden based on the values of a selected field. See section [Conditionally Hidden Elements](#txt:form:conditionally-hidden-elements) for more details.

#### Styles

The property `Style` allows you to customize model elements. Before you can set a `Style` for a button, you must
define `Styles` in the *Model Settings*. Refer to [Styles](#txt:detail:styles) in the Settings View.

To add a style to a model element:

1. Expand the *Styles* section.
2. Click the Add button.
3. Select one of the available styles defined in the model settings using the drop-down menu.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Be careful when combining **Styling** and **Styles** for buttons. It is possible to set a **Styling** *Primary* and a **Style**, for example, *button\_\_secondary*, to the same button. For some combinations, this might cause erroneous behavior. When migrating, the set **Style** will be used. |

#### Annotations

To add Annotations to Form Model elements, click any element in the [Screens View](#txt:editor:screen-view). Annotations can then be added in the bottommost section.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To add Annotations to field entries, click any Document Model element in the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view). In the editor form, choose the tab "Annotations". |

![annotations](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/annotations.png)

Figure 22. Edit Annotations

### Screen

A Screen refers to a distinct section or page within a form and serves as a logical grouping of related fields and information, called Screen Elements.

| Screen Element | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Section | [Section](#txt:detail:section) |
| Multi-Column Section | [Multi-Column Section](#txt:detail:multi-column-section) |
| Control Grid | [Control Grid](#txt:detail:control-grid) |
| Button Panel | [Button Panel](#txt:detail:button-panel) |
| Binding |  |
| Custom Screen Element |  |

A Form Model can consist of multiple Screens, between which navigation buttons (see [Button Details](#txt:section:button-details)) allow switching back and forth. Only the first Screen in a form can be assigned a specific Control within that Screen, which will be focused when the form is initially rendered. The following image shows the editor of a Screen and its drop-down menu, listing all paths of focusable elements.

![references focusableElement](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/references_focusableElement.png)

Figure 23. Screen Editor

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Controls that are set to read-only are not considered in the selection for an initially focused Control. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Controls to be initially focused should be placed near the top of the form, since focus is called together with scrollToTop, which cannot be disabled. Due to the master-detail layout animation, proper scrolling behavior cannot be ensured. The control will still be focused, even if it is not visible due to incorrect scrolling. |

### Section

Sections allow the grouping of different Screen elements by giving them a common headline. A Section is an optional element. It creates a hierarchical layer between the Screen and the Control Grid which is useful for ordering complex forms. With the collapsing feature, you can optimize the clarity of large forms.

![collapsible section](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/collapsible-section.png)

Figure 24. Collapsible Sections in `Preview`

The same control element can be part of multiple Sections. The number of occurrences of a field are shown in the Document Model section of the `Data Models View` next to the field’s name in brackets, for example, *FieldName (3)* for a field being used three times in the Form Model. The most recently set value will be propagated to all other occurrences of the field.

Sections are essential for realizing nested structures. You can place Sections into Sections and create any level of depth. Sections can only be placed in Screens and Sections and not in any other kind of element. To add fields to Sections you need to create a Control Grid inside a Section.

You can edit the properties by clicking on a Section. Name, multilingual labels, and the collapsing functionality can be set in the upcoming view.

![add section](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/add-section.png)

Figure 25. Section Settings

### Multi-Column Section

A Multi-Column Section is a special Section type that allows grouping Screen elements in a
horizontal manner. Up to twelve Screen elements can be displayed
horizontally next to each other.

![multi column section](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/multi-column-section.png)

Figure 26. New `Multi-Column Section`

Within a `Multi-Column Section`, other Sections as well as other Screen elements like Control Grids, Button Panels, and Repeats can be added. It is also possible to put a `Multi-Column Section` within another `Multi-Column Section`.

You can define a layout for a large horizontal space and if required also the responsive layouts `md` and `sm` for narrower space situations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is also a layout xs for extra small horizontal space. This layout is always present independent of the presence of the other layouts. It cannot be edited in the Form Model Editor. Its behavior is to show one element per row, ignoring span and offset. |

The layouts define the widths of the columns within the `Multi-Column Section`.
Each column is represented by a number from 1 to 12 and the columns are separated by dashes.

For example, you can set it to 3-3-6, which means that there are 3 columns where the first two columns each take up 1/4 of the total grid width and the third column 1/2.

For the large layout, the values for all columns can sum up to 12 at most. For the responsive layouts `md` and `sm` sums larger than 12 are allowed. This enables creating layouts with wrapping behavior since columns exceeding the sum of 12 will be shown wrapped to the next row.
The number of columns has to be equal among all layouts. Responsive layouts can only be provided when also a large layout is provided.

When there are no responsive layouts provided the large layout will be used for all space situations (except extra small, see [Note](#txt:detail-multi-column-section:note-xs) above).
When the responsive layouts are only provided partially, there is a fallback mechanism in place: The next wider layout available is used if, for the current width, no layout is present. For example, when the available space is medium wide but only layout `lg` and `sm` are present, the layout `lg` will be used.

By default, the layout `lg` is set to 12 when creating a new `Multi-Column Section` that contains no column at all.
The number of Screen elements allowed within a `Multi-Column Section` is determined by the number of layout columns.
You can only add so many elements via copy & paste, drag & drop, or the context menu.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The responsive layout of a screen element is based on its own width and not on the width of the entire form. Therefore, screen elements of different widths will switch between layouts at different times.  For example: A `Multi-Column Section` might still use layout `lg`, while a `Control Grid` inside this `Multi-Column Section` already switched to layout `md`.  Refer to the [A12 Widgets documentation](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/layout/layout-grid/template) for more details. |

### Control Grid

A Control Grid is the container for `Controls` and read-only texts. Such elements are never placed directly on a Screen - it is always placed
inside a Control Grid to define its position (for example, in a multi-column-grid).

![new control grid](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/new-control-grid.png)

Figure 27. Edit Control Grid

A Control Grid is organized by columns and rows. A `Control` is always
positioned in one column and one row thus all `Controls` have their exact
positions in a grid and their alignment can be automatically
controlled.

You can edit the properties of the Control Grid by clicking on it. The Form Model Editor
displays a view as seen in [Edit Control Grid](#fig:melies-edit-controlgrid).
This view has the following fields:

Name
:   Name of the Control Grid, used for example in setting up
    dependencies.

Layout `lg`
:   If you want to specify more than one column in your grid, you have to set a value for the layout `lg` property. Each column is represented by a number from 1 to 12 and the columns are separated by dashes. For each column, a value has to be specified. So in the case of three columns, a possible layout `lg` value would be 3-3-6, that is, the first two columns each take up 1/4 of the total grid width and the third column 1/2. The sum of the layout numbers can be 12 at most.

Layout `md` / `sm`
:   Similar to the [`Multi-Column Section`](#txt:detail:multi-column-section), you can define the responsive layouts `md` and `sm` for narrower horizontal space situations. The same features and rules as in the `Multi-Column Section` apply.

    When a responsive layout is removed, the offset and span configuration for the respective layout will be removed from all `Controls`, Text Cells, and Expression Cells within the Control Grid. This has to be confirmed by the user.

Readonly
:   `Control Grids` can be set to readonly. In this case, attempts to
    edit a value in the `Controls` inside the Control Grid are blocked. For date fields, the date picker
    icon will not be displayed. For required fields inside the Control Grid, the asterisk will not be shown.

Readonly presentation
:   Defines the read-only presentation for the `Controls`
    inside the Control Grid.

    * Default: Uses the read-only presentation defined in the model. If no presentation is defined in the model it renders the `Controls` as read-only Inputs if they are readonly
    * Input: `Controls` that are readonly will be rendered as a read-only input field
    * Text Output: `Controls` that are readonly will be rendered as plain text

![readonly presentation preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/readonly-presentation-preview.png)

Figure 28. Preview of Readonly Presentation

Vertical Alignment
:   Configuration for the vertical alignment of the Controls inside the Control Grid.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Form Model Editor allows adding more elements than allowed. The user then gets the error and can fix the arrangement.  Corresponding to adding this new behavior the automatic rearrangement of rows is dropped. Therefore, in the Form Model Editor for a row holding too many elements for a new layout, no "spillover" rows are generated anymore. |

### Row

A row is used to structure `Controls` inside a grid in case of a multi-column layout. Thus, each `Control` can have its exact position within a
column per row. [Add New Row](#fig:melies-new-row) shows the dialog for adding a new row.

![new row](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/new-row.png)

Figure 29. Add New Row

### Controls

`Controls` are input fields for the web form and must be
initially defined as data fields in the Document Model. A `Control` is the actual UI representation of a field
on the web form. The term `Control` is used to differentiate between the
field in the Document Model and its representation in the user interface.
After a field has been dragged into the `Screens View` to create a `Control`, you can open
the `Edit Control` dialog, as shown in [Edit Control](#fig:melies-edit-control), by clicking on
the respective `Control`.

Within the `Edit Control` dialog, several attributes are displayed, and most of them can be set.

![edit control](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/edit-control.png)

Figure 30. Edit Control

#### Common Settings

##### Internal Field Description (Document Model)

This section displays the internal field description that has been provided
in the Document Model for the underlying field of the `Control`. This description is
shown either in English, if present, or in the first locale of the Document
Model. This section is read-only.

##### Label

The label displayed in a form can have three origins:

###### Document Model

The `Document Model` section
displays the various multilingual labels that have been set up for the
`Control` within the Document Model. This section is read-only.

###### Field Configuration

With the `Field Configuration`, it is possible to (optionally) set a label for all controls that reference the same field used by this control.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When you define an `Expression` as the configuration label of a field, it will only be used as a fallback for `Controls`, but not for `Field Overview Columns`. |

###### Control

The `Control` label can deviate from the other two labels and is only considered for the single, specific `Control` in the form.

###### Label Hierarchy

This leads to the following hierarchy of labels, and the form engine will display:

* the Control label if present
* the Field Configuration label if present in this Form Model for the referenced field
* the label from the Document Model

##### Hint

As with [Label](#txt:detail:Label), the Hint shown at a `Control` in the form can have three origins. If the field is configured with a `Description (External)` in the Document Model, its content will be displayed as a Hint.

The `Field Configuration Hint` and `Control Hint`
attributes allow you to provide context-help information in several
locales for the form if no `Description (External)` has been configured.

![hints hierarchy](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/hints-hierarchy.png)

Figure 31. Edit Control Section for Hints

The *hint* attribute is an additional (possibly longer) text displayed
when hovering over the "info" icon. It will appear next to your input or, in the case of enumeration expositions, next to the label of the `Control`.

![hints preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/hints-preview.png)

Figure 32. Preview of Several Field / Control Types and Their Hints

###### Hint Hierarchy

This leads to the following hierarchy of hint texts, and the form engine will display:

* the `Control Hint` if present
* the `Field Configuration Hint` if present in this Form Model for the referenced field
* the `Description (External)` from the Document Model

##### Placeholder

With the `Placeholder Label (Multilingual)` attribute, a placeholder can be defined that will be displayed in a text or selection input if no value is entered yet.

![placeholder](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/placeholder.png)

Figure 33. Placeholder Example

##### Layout

The layout of the `Control` can be specified by `` Offset `lg` `` and
`` Span `lg ``. Within the whole grid layout of the containing `Control Grid`, the offset defines the number of empty cells (starting from the left) and the span defines the number of columns the `Control` is spanned.

The following pictures show an example:

![layout](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/layout.png)

Figure 34. Configuration of Span and Offset in Control Settings

![layout preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/layout-preview.png)

Figure 35. Preview in Browser of Configured Example

If the model contains a responsive layout anywhere, offset and span can be defined for the layouts `lg`, `md` and `sm` individually. But offset and span `md` and `sm` are only editable, when the parent `Control Grid` has a value for the respective layout.

The offset configuration of a `Control` in a responsive layout is only valid if the total width of the layout columns taken up by the `Control`'s offset is not larger than 12. The same applies to the span configuration. The total width of the layout columns spanned by the `Control` must not be larger than 12.

Mind that it is not possible to create an empty row by using an offset over the full grid width since the invisible element creating the offset has no height.

![layout offset span](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/layout-offset-span.png)

Figure 36. Configuration of Offset and Span for Responsive Layouts

##### Additional Settings

The contents of the `Additional Settings` section
of the "Edit Control" view can vary depending on the data type of the
'Control'. This will be described in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.

###### Initial Value

The initial value can be set to a value according to the data type of the underlying field of the `Control`. This value will be used when editing an "empty" form or when adding a new row in a repeat.

When modeling initial values, for Controls of certain field data types just an input is shown. In this case the following data formats need to be used for the value:

| Data Type | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | no special format | my initial string value |
| Number | a number potentially using a "." as decimal separator | 1234.5 |
| Date | yyyy-MM-dd | 2024-05-16 |
| Time | HH:mm:ss | 15:30:00 |
| DateTime | yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ss  The 'T' means the **actual letter T**, but without quotes | 2024-05-16T15:30:00 |
| DateFragment | MM  yyyy  MM-dd  yyyy-MM  depending on the DateFragment format of the field | 05  2024  05-16  2024-05 |
| DateRange | yyyy/yyyy  yyyy-MM-dd/yyyy-MM-dd  MM/MM  yyyy-MM/yyyy-MM  MM-dd/MM-dd  depending on the DateRange format of the field | 2024/2028  2024-05-16/2028-10-17  05/10  2024-05/2028-10  05-16/10-17 |

###### Exposition

`Controls` can be rendered in different styles. These
styles are called *Expositions*. The Expositions offered depend on the Data Type and are briefly described in the respective sections.
Default expositions will be marked with the suffix "(default)". They are not persisted in the Form Model and may change
in future (breaking) releases.

###### Position of Hint and Validation Message

Positioning of the hint and the validation messages on the `Control` can be configured to fit different spacing conditions.

When 'Default' is selected, validation messages will be rendered above the `Control` and the hint icon will be rendered behind.

![tooltip and messages default](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/tooltip-and-messages-default.png)

Figure 37. Tooltip and Messages in Default Position

Selecting 'Beside Control' will result in the validation messages being rendered as tooltips beside the `Control`, which might be required when the form has limited height.

![tooltip and messages beside](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/tooltip-and-messages-beside.png)

Figure 38. Tooltip and Messages Beside Control

Selecting 'Above Control' will result in the validation messages being rendered as tooltips together with the `Control` tooltip above the `Control`. This might help in forms with limited width.

![tooltip and messages above](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/tooltip-and-messages-above.png)

Figure 39. Tooltip and Messages Above Control

###### Readonly

`Controls` can be set to read-only. In this case, attempts to
edit a value in the `Control` are blocked. For date fields, the date picker
icon will not be displayed. For required fields, the asterisk will not be shown.

###### Readonly Presentation

Defines the read-only presentation for the `Control`.

* Default: Uses the read-only presentation of the parent `Control Grid` or model. If no presentation is defined for the parent `Control Grid` or the model it renders a `Control`, which is read-only as a read-only Input.
* Input: Renders a `Control`, which is read-only, as a read-only Input
* Text Output: Renders the `Control`, which is read-only, as plain text

![readonly presentation preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/readonly-presentation-preview.png)

Figure 40. Preview of Readonly Presentation

###### Show Asterisk

Depending on the setting, an asterisk will be shown on the label of this control.

* If required: An asterisk will only be shown if the referenced field is required.
* Never: An asterisk will never be shown.
* Always: An asterisk will be shown on the label, regardless of the required status of the referenced field.
  It will not be shown, if the field is readonly, disabled or computed.

##### Control Index

This section is only visible if a `Control` is placed outside its nested repeatable group. It is possible to configure the condition for selecting the right repeatable group instance. This is easily done by defining a numeric (number of rows) or semantic index (value of index field of the row) to identify the repeatable group instance.

![control index](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/control-index.png)

Figure 41. Edit Control Index

This is limited to only one level of repeatability between the context of the `Control Grid` and the used field.

Currently, no checks are applied to the value field. Double-check your values.

In the Form Engine, the nested repeatable group will be created if the value of a corresponding `Control` changes and no suitable repeatable group can be found. Furthermore, if a `Control` of a nested repeat exists and an initial value is defined, then the Form Engine will create the corresponding entry of the nested repeatable group with the creation of the parent context.

##### Accessibility

`Controls` support accessibility by having their label programmatically connected to their input. This, for example, allows screen readers to read the label for the input or allows that the input gets the focus when clicking on the label. The accessibility section provides configuration options for this.

###### Hide Label

If the design of the web form requires that the label of `Control` shouldn’t be visible, it can be hidden with the 'Hide Label' option. This will only visually hide the defined label, but still keep it available for accessibility tools.

#### String Type

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The settings `Exposition` and `Secret` are not available for a field of type String that has `Suggestions` since they are not useful in this case. |

Exposition
:   * **text line (default):**
      renders the `Control` as a text line
    * **Area:**
      renders the `Control` as a text box
      that enables a multi-line input and breaks automatically. If you did not
      set *Line Breaks Permitted* for strings in the Document Model , you will
      get an error message when doing a manual line break via enter.

      When the exposition is set to **Area** you can set the option **Auto Expand**. In this case, the multi-line input will initially be shown as a single-line input and then expand automatically depending on the space needed by the inserted text.
      [Auto Expand Example](#fig:auto-expand) shows how the different options are rendered.

      ![auto expand](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/auto-expand.png)

      Figure 42. Auto Expand Example

Secret
:   The `Secret` attribute is only valid for fields of type
    String that do not have the exposition ’Area’ set and whose underlying
    Document Model fields do not have the property ’Line Breaks Permitted’
    set to true. When a `Secret` is set, it does not reveal the content of the
    field while editing (for example, for passwords). The entered value is hidden
    and represented by asterisks.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Setting a `Control` to `secret` will only visually hide its content. The setting will not affect other `Controls` for the same field and has no additional security aspects. |

Autocomplete
:   Since `Controls` are input fields, the `autoComplete` attribute can be provided to them in order to automatically fill out the field. You can specify which value should be passed to the `autoComplete` HTML attribute through a selection field. The values are sourced from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#values). The only exception is the value "chrome-off." The reason for this is that the autocomplete="off" instruction is not supported in the Chrome browser. To make it work in Chrome, you need to use a value other than "off." The designation of `chrome-off` also serves to inform the developer about the approach.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `autoComplete` attribute can also be set on Columns that are an input field. |

##### External Enumeration

External enumerations are a means to provide enumeration values from
external sources. The corresponding fields must be modeled as a string
within the Document Model, not as enumerations. The following steps have to
be performed when applying an external enumeration.

1. Navigate to the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view)
2. Click on the favoured field of type string
3. From the upcoming `Edit Field Configuration Entry`, click on `External enumeration > Set External Enumeration`
4. Within the view shown in [View for Selecting an External Enumeration](#fig:select-melies-external_enum), specify a `Source URL` which delivers the enumeration value
5. Select an `Exposition` (see [Enumerations](#txt:enumeration))

![external enumeration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/external-enumeration.png)

Figure 43. View for Selecting an External Enumeration

When the exposition autocomplete was chosen, it is possible to configure
more properties of the external enumeration:

Allow custom values
:   Enables entering a custom value independent
    of the values provided by the external enumeration source.

Case sensitive
:   To determine, if the entered value is a custom
    value or one of the provided values, the values are compared, ignoring
    the case by default. When this option is checked, the comparison happens
    in a case-sensitive way. For example, the entered value "cat" would be
    recognized as distinct from the provided value "Cat" and added as a custom value.

##### Differences Between Enumeration, External Enumeration and String Field with Suggestions

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Enumeration** | **External Enumeration** | **String Field with Suggestions** |
| Values are defined in | Field Editor | Data Configuration View (as external source) | Field Editor |
| Exposition | Selection of different options (see [Enumerations](#txt:enumeration)) | Selection of different options (see [Enumerations](#txt:enumeration)) | Autocomplete |
| Custom value | No | Can be set when exposition is set to autocomplete | Yes |
| Case sensitive | No | Can be set when exposition is set to autocomplete and custom values are allowed | Yes |
| Localization | Each value is localized | Each value is localized | Suggestions can be defined for each locale |

#### Number Type

Suffix
:   With the `Suffix (Multilingual)` attribute a `Suffix` can be defined for `Controls` based on number fields, for example, to display a currency or physical unit. You need to define a `Suffix` for each locale of your model. If it is the same for all of your locales you can use the "Fill All" button to fill the `Suffix` for all locales.

    When creating a `Control` based on a number field that has the unit 'percent' or 'permille', the `Suffix` will be prefilled with the respective symbol (%, ‰).

    A global `Amount Suffix` can be defined in the `Model Settings` and will be used for `Controls` based on number fields with unit 'amount'. It can be either static or dynamic.
    When static, the given value is simply used in all applicable places. When dynamic, the localized value of the referenced enumeration field is used instead.
    The global `Suffix` can be overwritten per number field by setting a `Suffix` in the `Control` settings.

    The number of decimal places to render is defined on the referenced number field in the Document Model.

    When a `Suffix` is set on the `Control`, it will take precedence over the number of suffixes set in the model.

Truncate suffix
:   In `Controls` based on number fields, checking this option will display long suffixes of number `Controls` truncated, for example, when the horizontal space is limited. The full suffix is visible when hovering over the snippet.
    Mind: If "Text Output" is set as a read-only presentation and the `Control` is read-only this option will not take effect.

    ![suffix](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/suffix.png)

    Figure 44. Suffix Configuration

Exposition
:   No exposition so far.

#### Boolean Type

Exposition
:   * **Boolean Select (default)**:
      renders the `Control` as a drop down menu
    * **Checkbox**:
      renders the `Control` as a checkbox
    * **Switch**:
      renders the `Control` as a switch
    * **Switch-With-Values**:
      renders the `Control` as a switch with labels for both options, for example, "yes" and "no" for English localization
    * **Full**:
      renders the `Control` as a vertical radio button list
    * **Inline**:
      renders the `Control` as a horizontal radio button list

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The only exposition that allows a user to select all three values is Boolean Select. All other expositions show no initial selection and then switch between the `true` and `false` values. |

#### Date Type

Exposition
:   * **Data Type Date**
      No exposition so far. Nevertheless, you can customize
      some values. The range of years can be configured as Relative or Absolute.
      The default value is -7/+7 from the current year. With [Preview](#subsec:preview) you can check
      how it will be displayed in the Form Engine.

      ![date config](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/date-config.png)

      Figure 45. Date Configuration

      In the Form Engine, you see an icon in the date field. When you click it
      a date picker appears.

      ![date picker](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/date-picker.png)

      Figure 46. Date Picker

      There is no picker support for partially known dates, you need to enter them in the input field.
      If you entered a partially known date and open the date picker, then the current date (taking the preselection year into account) will be preselected in the date picker.

#### Date Time Type

Exposition
:   No exposition so far. In the Form Engine, you see an icon next to the date time field.
    When you click it, a date time picker appears showing a date selector.

    ![date time picker](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/date-time-picker.png)

    Figure 47. Date Time Picker

    After clicking `EDIT TIME` a time picker will appear showing a time
    selector. The time selector respective to its format depends on the set
    locale and therefore will be displayed as 12 hours (with a.m./p.m.) or
    24 hours circle.

    ![date time picker 12](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/date-time-picker-12.png)

    Figure 49. Date Time Picker 24 Hours Format

#### Time Type

Exposition
:   No exposition so far. In the Form Engine, you see an
    icon next to the time field. Clicking the icon will trigger a time
    picker. This provides the same functionality as the time selector of the
    date time picker. It will be displayed in a 12 or 24 hours time format
    depending on the set locale.

#### Date Fragment Type

Exposition
:   No exposition so far. In the Form Engine, you see a text input for this data type. There is currently no date picker support for date fragments.

#### Date Range Type

Exposition
:   No exposition so far. In the Form Engine, you see a text input with an icon button for this data type. Clicking the icon button will trigger a date range picker.

    ![date range](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/date-range.png)

    Figure 50. Date Range Picker

    The picker is only supported for date ranges of fully defined dates (year, month, and day). For ranges of date fragments a text input without the button is shown.

#### Enumeration Type

Exposition
:   * **compact (default)**:
      renders the `Control` as a drop-down list. If the field is not required or no initial value is selected, an empty option is implicitly added to the list of enumeration options.
    * **autocomplete**:
      renders the `Control` as a drop-down list and
      provides autocompletion
    * **full**:
      renders the `Control` as a vertical radio button list
    * **inline**:
      renders the `Control` as a horizontal radio button list

      [Different Expositions for an Enumeration Control](#fig:melies-enumerations) shows the drop-down box for the
      exposition field of an enumerations field.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | Mind that `Expositions` are defined per `Control` and therefore all settings are provided for each reference of a field. This means if you are using the same field within Inline and Detached Repeat the set `Expositions` is the same but will be displayed differently. Within a Screen, also for the Detached Repeats Details Screen, all four `Expositions` can be displayed. In an Inline Repeat table structure all `Expositions` other than "autocomplete" are shown as a "compact" drop-down list within the row. |

#### Confirm Type

Exposition
:   * **Checkbox (default)**:
      renders the `Control` as a checkbox
    * **Switch**:
      renders the `Control` as a switch
    * **Switch-With-Values**:
      renders the `Control` as a switch with a label for the *truthy* option, for example, "yes" for English localization. For the *no value* option no label is rendered by default, but could be provided via customization using the localization API.

#### Attachment Type

Attachments are groups from a data point of view. However, they can be used in two ways:

1. Standard Use Case

   In most cases, the attachment group should be treated like a field and be used to create a `Control` or repeat column. It will then be displayed as a `File Picker`.
   When you click it, the native file select dialog will pop up and you can select the file you like to attach.

   Mind that the default behavior is to save the data into the document and
   it is highly recommended to use the custom AttachmentHandler for bigger
   data to store the attachment outside the document.
2. Special Use Case

   The fields of an attachment group can also be used individually to create `Controls` or columns. However, changing values like the content or id of an attachment might lead to undesired behavior. Therefore, such `Controls` and columns will be automatically set to read-only with the read-only presentation "Text Output", when they are created.
   These settings can be adapted manually after creation. However, except for the category and description of an attachment, it is strongly recommended to keep these fields read-only.

   ![file picker](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/file-picker.png)

   Figure 53. File Picker

   Images will be displayed directly within the model if the exposition is not set to compact. All other files can just be downloaded.

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | Limitation: The tiff image format is not supported by browsers. Therefore, only the image placeholder icon will be shown when uploading images with this file type. |

   ![image attachment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/image-attachment.png)

   Figure 54. Image Attachment

   In a popup menu, you find the `Replace`, `Download` and `Delete` option.

   ![attachment popup menu](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/attachment-popup-menu.png)

   Figure 55. Image Attachment With Popup Menu

Exposition
:   |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Note that the exposition for attachment inputs has to be set individually for every `Control`/column (in contrast to other data types, where the same exposition is used for all inputs that reference the same Form Model element). |

    You can pick one of the following options:

    * **file preview (default):**
      Renders the attachment as a `File Picker`, which will show a thumbnail for uploaded image files. If the uploaded attachment is not an image or no valid thumbnail could be retrieved by the AttachmentHandler, an icon will be shown. This icon will be determined by the MIME type of attachment.
    * **compact:**
      Renders a compact version of the `File Picker`, which only shows the name of the uploaded file and an icon for the corresponding MIME type. No placeholder or preview images will be displayed.

    For attachment columns there is an additional exposition option:

    * **thumbnail or icon:**
      Renders a thumbnail for uploaded image files. If the uploaded attachment is not an image or no valid thumbnail could be retrieved by the AttachmentHandler, an icon will be shown. This icon will be determined by the MIME type of attachment.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | This exposition is only used for the display of uploaded files. If no file has been uploaded yet, nothing will be shown. |

##### Attachment Settings

These settings are exclusive to attachments and cannot be edited for other data types. They are saved in the field configuration entry for the underlying attachment group. Therefore, these settings affect every input for the corresponding attachment.

![attachment settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/attachment-settings.png)

Figure 56. Attachment Settings

Placeholder Icon
:   The placeholder icon that is shown for an attachment input, if no file is uploaded yet. The available options for placeholder icons are

    * **Default** (This option will be used if there is no placeholder icon set in the model)
    * **Image**
    * **Text**
    * **Spreadsheet**
    * **PDF**
    * **Video**
    * **Sound**
    * **None**

Default Action
:   The default action that will be executed when clicking on an attachment input after a file has been uploaded. The available options are

    * **Download**:
      Clicking on the attachment upload will automatically trigger a download of the given file.
    * **Replace**:
      Clicking on the attachment upload will open a dialog to upload a new file. This is the default behavior.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | The default action **Replace** will only be executed if the input is editable. When the input is readonly, this setting will be overridden and a download will be triggered instead, because it is the only possible action in this case. This will happen in any of the following cases:  + The Control/column is set to readonly. + A parent element of the Control/column is set to readonly. + The attachment is shown in a column of a `Detached` or `Embedded Repeat` overview table. |

Accepted MIME Types
:   With the accept property you can provide a comma-separated list of MIME types that should be accepted by inputs for this attachment group (for example, image/jpeg, video/\*, application/msword, …​).

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | It is important to note that this will not actually restrict the file types that can be uploaded by the user but only affects the file types that are initially suggested to the user when opening the file upload dialog. |

#### Multi-Select Type

Exposition
:   The Multi-Select supports the following expositions:

    * **autocomplete (default)**:
      renders the `Control` as an auto-complete in which multiple entries can be selected
    * **full**:
      renders the `Control` as a vertical checkbox group
    * **inline**:
      renders the `Control` as a horizontal check-box list

      ![multi select expositions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/multi_select_expositions.png)

      Figure 57. Different Expositions for a Multi-Select

      When the exposition is set to **full** or **inline** you can set the **Enable select all option**. In this case, the checkbox group will show a checkbox for selecting and de-selecting all options at once.

      If a hint should be defined for the Multi-Select, it can be done in the usual way in the Form Model Editor global or per `Control`.

      If the hint or a helper text should already be defined in the Document Model, it can be edited in the Document Model Editor on the 'value' field of the Multi-Select.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | For columns of data type multi select all `Expositions` other than "autocomplete" are shown as a "compact" drop-down list within the row. |

Show as comma-separated list
:   This setting is only available for Multi-Selects as repeat columns. It will show the multi-select values as a comma-separated list instead of bullet points. For Inline Repeats, it is also required to set the "Readonly presentation" to "Text Output".

##### External Enumeration for Multi-Select

It is also possible to add an external enumeration to a multi-select group if its value field is of type String.
In this case, as described in [External Enumeration](#txt:details:external-enumeration), the value field can be clicked in the `Data Configuration View` to apply the external enumeration. Note that when applying the external enumeration, only the `Source URL` can be specified. This is because the exposition is set by the multi-select itself.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If such a multi-select with a value field of type String is used somewhere in the form, specifying an external enumeration for it is mandatory. Without it, a consistency problem will be reported. |

#### Custom Type

Exposition
:   No exposition so far.

### Text Cell

The Form Model Editor provides text cells that allow the user to add custom text displayed read-only in the web interface. Text cells are organized in `Control Grids`. They can be added using the menu of `Rows`. The dialog is shown in [Add a New Text](#fig:melies-new-text).

![add new text](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/add-new-text.png)

Figure 58. Add a New Text

Decoration
:   A display variant for the text can be chosen in the drop-down.

    * None
    * Info
    * Warning
    * Success
    * Error

Text
:   The text message for each locale in
    case of multilingual web interfaces can be entered. They allow entering a multi-line
    text which can be formatted using standard HTML syntax.

|  |  |

|  | Accessibility test recommended! For further information look into the [Get A12 Documentation for Accessibility](https://geta12.com/docs/PLASMA/accessibility/index.html). |

### Button

Buttons allow the user to trigger certain actions.

They can be displayed in different places:

* **within a form Screen:**
  defined as the children of a Button Panel
* **in the subheader or footer of a specific Screen:**
  defined in the Screen editor.
* **visible in the subheader or footer of every Screen:**
  created in the Settings.

The global buttons are always shown on the left of the Screen specific buttons.

![subheader footer view](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/subheader-footer-view.png)

Figure 59. Subheader and Footer View

Subheader buttons can be modeled in two lists - one for *major buttons* and one for *minor buttons*.

In the resulting form, the **navigation buttons** of both lists are mixed together in a tabbed navigation bar above the form content.
For more information, see the [Form Engine](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_sub_header_and_footer_buttons) documentation.

The **event buttons** are shown in an action bar below the tabbed navigation bar. The event buttons from the *major* list are shown in a left-aligned group, the buttons from the *minor* list in a right-aligned group.

Footer buttons can be modeled in a *minor* and *major* list as well. In the footer, navigation buttons and event buttons are shown together and not separated into different "bars". Here, the minor buttons are left-aligned and the major buttons right-aligned.

Furthermore, the buttons in the subheader and footer area will be collapsed into popup menus if there is not enough space available.

To create a button visible on all form Screens:

* go to `Settings`
* open the `Subheader and Footer` tab
* click `Add` under the respective list
* fill out the details for the new button in the following dialog and click `Commit`

![edit button](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/edit-button.png)

Figure 60. Edit Button

To create a button visible on one Screen:

* click on the Screen to open its editor
* open the `Subheader and Footer` tab
* click `Add` under the respective list
* fill out the details for the new button in the following dialog and click `Commit`

The created form buttons and Screen buttons can be reordered inside their lists.
This is possible using the `Move Down` and `Move Up` buttons.
There is also an option using the three dotted menu to move buttons between the lists.

#### Button Details

The following properties can be configured for a button:

Name
:   Enter a name for the button. It must be unique within its button panel or header/footer.

#### Button Functions

Buttons have different parameters depending on the button type.

Button Type
:   In the Form Model we differentiate two types of buttons:

    * **Event:**
      Event buttons fire a (custom) event that can be handled in the application embedding this form. The parameter `Event Name` is used in the (custom) code that handles this event. There are three event names available by default. These are automatically handled by the Client CRUD extension. For more information on the semantics of these events, refer to the chapter about the CRUD extension within the Client documentation.
    * **Navigation:**
      Navigation buttons allow navigating to other Screens. The "target" parameter defines the Screen to navigate to. This can either be the previous or next Screen or it can be a specific Screen that has been set up within the `Screens View` of the Form Model Editor (see [Screens View](#txt:editor:screen-view)).

      ![navigation button](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/navigation-button.png)

      Figure 61. Navigation Button

Validation-Mode
:   Buttons can specify different validation behaviors.

    * `No Validation`: No validation is triggered on a button press.
    * `Partial Validation`: A validation of relevant elements on the current Screen is executed with a button press. If the validation result contains at least one parsing error or validation error, the default button behavior is not triggered.
    * `Full Validation`: A validation of the entire document is executed with a button press. If the validation result contains at least one parsing error or validation error, the default button behavior is not triggered and a [validation bar](#subsec:validation) will be displayed.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | Validation rules may also produce **warnings** or **info** messages rather than errors. These do not block the button behavior directly. Instead, a confirmation dialog may be shown to the user, allowing them to acknowledge the messages and proceed or cancel the action. This confirmation behavior is controlled by the [Rule Confirmation Settings](#txt:form:model-settings:rule-confirmation) in the Model Settings. See the `Disable Rule Confirmation Dialog` property for details on suppressing the confirmation dialog for warning and info level messages. |

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | The different validation modes only consider data, that was not marked as non-relevant via dependencies.  While a full validation executes all Validation Rules, that were defined in the Document Model, a partial validation only executes a subset of these rules. This subset depends on the set of fields, that is considered as relevant for the current Screen.  Usually, a field is considered as relevant for the Screen if one of the following conditions is met for every referenced field of a rule:  + There is a visible `Control` for the field on the current Screen + There is a visible Inline Repeat column for the field on the current Screen + The field is set to global in the Document Model  For a more detailed description of the validation behavior and how the relevant fields are determined, refer to the [Form Engine documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#form-engine_validation-computation_validation). |

Scope
:   Buttons can be set to be hidden or disabled, depending on the read-only state of the form. By default, buttons will always be enabled, but will only be shown, if the form is not set to `read-only`. Therefore `Hide Button in Readonly Mode` will be preselected, when creating a new button.

    * `Always`: The button will always be shown and enabled.
    * `Disable Button in Edit Mode`: The button will be disabled if the form is in edit mode, that is, not set to `read-only`.
    * `Disable Button in Readonly Mode`: The button will be disabled if the form is in `read-only` mode.
    * `Hide Button in Edit Mode`: The button will be hidden if the form is in edit mode.
    * `Hide Button in Readonly Mode`: The button will be hidden if the form is in `read-only` mode.

No data change
:   (Only available for buttons of type `Event`)
    This option defines how the button should be displayed if no data changed in the form yet.

    * `Disable Button`: The button will be disabled button as long as the data did not change.
    * `Hide Button`: The button will be hidden as long as the data did not change.
    * `Show enabled Button` (default value): The button will always be shown and enabled.

      If one of these options is selected, the button will be enabled/shown as soon as the user entered some input in any of the `Controls` in this form and leaves the current `Control`. Once the button is enabled/shown it will not be disabled/hidden again as long as this form is opened.

#### Visual Settings

All buttons are displayed as `Secondary` and *non-*`Destructive` per default and will appear as a blue text link. This default value can be changed in the `Visual Settings`

Priority
:   Sets the style of the button to either `Secondary` or `Primary`.

Destructive
:   Sets the color of the button. If destructive is ticked then the
    corresponding button is displayed in red. This might be useful to
    amplify the button’s action, for example, a red Cancel button.

    ![button preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/button-preview.png)

    Figure 62. Button in Preview

Icon
:   Sets the icon which is shown next to the button label. An icon picker allows selecting the available icons. Different icon themes are available. Consult the [A12 Widgets documentation](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/general/icon#themes).

    ![button icon](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/button-icon.png)

    Figure 63. Button With Icon

Hide Label
:   The label of the button can be hidden with the hide label option. This will only visually hide the label, but it is still available for accessibility tools.

    For accessibility reasons and in cases where due to missing space the button is moved into a popup menu, you should always provide a label for the button.

    Furthermore, an icon needs to be given when hide label is selected. Otherwise, the button would be invisible in the form.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When the label is hidden with `hide label` and no description is given, the label is also used in the button tooltip on hover.  For Navigation Buttons, when no label is given, neither in the model nor through the localization API, and the target Screen has a label, then this is used as fallback label for the Button. |

#### Description

A multilingual description of the button. If set, it is used in a tooltip when hovering over the button. It is also available for accessibility tools, for example, contained in the text read by screen readers.

### Button Panel

Button panels are a container element for buttons. They can be added to Screens, Sections and Multi-Column Sections. The [Edit Button Panel](#fig:melies-edit-buttonpanel) shows the dialog for editing the button panel "Navigation" which contains three buttons:
Validate, Save, and Submit.

![edit button panel](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/edit-button-panel.png)

Figure 64. Edit Button Panel

Buttons within a button panel will be left aligned per default. If you
like to change the alignment it is not done via minor or major button
lists. This can be done by using `Styles`, for example, `h_floatRight` (also
see [Styles](#txt:detail:styles)).

### Expressions

`Expressions` are a solution for displaying field values as read-only information. In addition to single values, such as read-only table cells in repeats, they can also be used to create complex composites. For more details about this topic, refer to the [Expression Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/expression/expression-docs/index.html).

There are different variants of `Expressions`:

* An "Expression Cell" can be placed inside Control Grids next to Controls and text cells.
* An "Expression Column" can be defined on `Repeats` as a repeat column, similar to field-based columns.
* An "Expression Label" can be set for most model elements:

  + Screens
  + Sections
  + Multi-Column Sections
  + Control Grids
  + Rows
  + Controls
  + Expression Cells
  + Button Panels
  + Buttons
  + Repeats
  + Row Actions
  + Field Overview Columns
  + Expression Overview Columns
* Furthermore, an Expression can be used to set a permanent filter for repeats (see [Filter Expressions](#filter:expression)).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When defining an Expression, the following two scenarios must be distinguished:  1. The expression is defined as an expression cell in a Control Grid or as an expression label, which is not placed inside a repeat.    In this case, when referencing fields, the absolute reference to a field must be set using `kontext` statements. 2. The expression is defined as an expression column on a repeat, as an expression cell in a Control Grid inside a repeat, or as an expression label inside a repeat, such as in a Detached Repeat Detail Screen.    In this case, only relative field references to fields of the repeat’s referenced repeatable group or further nested child groups are supported.    The repeat’s group is used automatically as the scope of the expression; therefore, absolute field references are not valid. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Expression labels should not contain line breaks or paragraphs, because they will not be displayed correctly if the expression is rendered as a label or title. |

Creating a new `Expression`:

* On a `Control Grid` row:

  + Right-click on the row and click on `Expression` from the context menu or use the keyboard shortcut `Alt+X`.
* On a `Repeat`:

  + Right-click on the repeat and click on `Expression Column` or use the keyboard shortcut `Alt+O`.

![expression from context](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/expression-from-context.png)

Figure 65. Add Expression From Context Menu

This will bring up the following dialogs:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Accessibility testing is recommended. For further information, refer to the [Get A12 Documentation for Accessibility](https://geta12.com/docs/PLASMA/accessibility/index.html). |

#### Formatting of Expressions

The formatting of `Expressions` can be done according to the *Markdown* syntax. All formatting instructions must be inside quoted text. Detailed information can be found in the [Expression Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/expression/expression-docs/index.html).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Using formatted `Expressions` for any titles and/or labels will break [accessibility](https://geta12.com/docs/PLASMA/accessibility/index.html)! |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Markdown behaves differently if empty strings are wrapped with the formatting types mentioned above. Thus, empty field values should be excluded with a case statement. E.g.:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 ``` | ``` case[stringField] != "" {"**" [stringField] "**"} ``` | ``` |

##### Examples

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` "for " [packagingAmount] " "  [packagingMaterial] " " [packagingType]  " = "  "**"[shippingCosts]"**" ``` |
```

Then it looks like this:

![form expression example2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/form-expression-example2.png)

Now let us have a look at a more comprehensive example of an `Expression`.

The Form Model could look like this:

![expression example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/expression-example.png)

Figure 69. Example of a Form Model using various Expressions

The definition of the example `Expressions` are:

"controlGridExpressionString"

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` kontext(top){[string]} ``` |
```

"2ndControlGridexpressionEnum+Datetime"

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` kontext(top) {     kontext(sub) {         case [enum] = "sun" {             kontext(subsub) {                 [datetime]             }         }     } } ``` |
```

"repeatExpressionString"

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` (en:"value: ",de:"Wert: ")[string] ``` |
```

Figure 70. Result of the Expression in the Preview

Sometimes referencing to a group might get tricky, so here is a complex `Expression` with several conditions and usage of nested repeatable
groups.

Mind that referencing only works downwards, **not** upwards.

![model with nested group](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/model-with-nested-group.png)

Figure 71. Model with Nested Repeatable Groups

Example for `Expression`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` kontext(subsub1) {     case [enum1] = "1" {         kontext(subsubsub1) {[enum3]}     }     case [enum1] = "2" {[enum2]}     case [enum1] = "3" {"-"}     case [enum1] = "4" {         kontext(subsub2) {             kontext (subsubsub2) {[number1]}         }     } } ``` |
```

![expression kontext](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/expression-kontext.png)

Figure 72. Preview of Expression with Several Cases

Depending on the selected enumeration value from "enum1" a different
resulting `Expression` value will be shown. This displayed value might be
a constant or a value coming from another field.

### Repeats

Based on a repeatable group data structure, which can be defined at the group level within the Document Model, the Form Model Editor makes it possible to easily generate complex user interfaces that allow you to create, edit, and delete repeatable data sets, such as one or multiple addresses. These user interfaces are called *Repeats*. There are three different types of *Repeats*: the `Inline Repeat`, the `Detached Repeat`, and the `Embedded Repeat`. Their differences are explained in the following chapters.

An overview table is displayed for all repeatable items. Depending on the configuration of the *Repeat* columns, all or some of the data of the repeatable data structure will be displayed with multilingual headers. The values in the overview table can be provided in several ways. They can be shown using a direct field reference or by using an `Expression` (see [Expressions](#txt:details:expression)). For empty repeats or tables, a default message `There are no entries yet` will be displayed.

Furthermore, the available row actions will be displayed in an additional action column at the end of each *Repeat* row.
These row actions are also available in a context menu that can be accessed with a right-click on the corresponding row.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Row Action context menu will not be opened by right-clicking an input Control or a Row Action button. The browser context menu will be opened in these cases. |

Before repeats can be created in the Form Model, the respective repeatable groups must be defined in the Document Model, as shown in [Repeatable Groups in the Document Model Editor](#fig:melies-repeat-picus-model). In square brackets behind the group name, you can see the maximum number of instances of the data sets that can be created.

For all repeat types, it is required that all referenced fields are located in
the same repeatable group, including subgrouping below the repeatable
group level (see also nested repeats in
[Nested Repeats](#fig:form-nested-repeats)).

![repeats in dmm](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/repeats-in-dmm.png)

Figure 73. Repeatable Groups in the Document Model Editor

More details on how to model repeatable structures are provided in
the Document Modeling documentation. Once the repeatable group is present in the Document Model, you can follow the instructions in
[Add/Edit a Repeat](#subsec:add-edit-repeat).

#### Inline Repeat

With `Inline Repeats`, all data is edited directly inside the overview table, that is, without the need to click *edit* in the user interface. An
example of the UI is shown in [User Interface for Inline Repeats](#fig:detail-dialogs:inline-browser). In that example, the *Repeat* has the label `All Persons`.

|  | With a growing number of columns or rows, `Inline Repeats` can significantly slow down the entire form, especially on weaker devices such as smartphones. To mitigate the slowdown:  * Keep the number of columns low * Use pagination with a small page size * Activate infinite scrolling |

#### Detached Repeat

As mentioned above, for modeling `Detached Repeats` in the Form Model, the required
repeatable groups must have been defined in the Document Model first. For Detached Repeats, all data can only be edited inside a `Detail Screen`, which results in a separate form. Committing the changes in this form will trigger a partial validation of its content.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that some Validation Rules might not be executed when committing the changes on a `Detail Screen`. See [Validation Mode](#txt:detail:button:validation-mode) for more information. |

[Screen View With a Detached Repeat](#fig:screen-content:detached-repeat) shows an example of a `Detached Repeat` with a `Detail Screen` that contains a `Control Grid` and several `Controls`.

![screen view with detached](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/screen-view-with-detached.png)

Figure 77. Detail Screen of a Detached Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)

[Detached Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)](#fig:melies-detached-overview) shows the overview table of a `Detached Repeat`. Because values cannot be changed on this overview, they are displayed with their read-only text output presentation.

![detached preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/detached-preview.png)

Figure 78. Detached Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)

##### Detached Repeat Detail Screen

The `Detached Repeat Detail Screen` can contain the same elements as a top level Screen. The following is just an example.

1. Add a `Control Grid` to the `Detail Screen` by using the context menu
   and selecting, for example, `Control Grid` or using the keyboard shortcut.
2. Now Controls can be dragged from the Document Model section of the `Data Models View` onto the `Control Grid` that has been created in the previous step. Mind that it is not possible to add `Controls` to a `Detached Repeat` Detail Screen without a `Control Grid`.
3. Finally, the Columns that should be visible in the `Detached Repeat` overview have to be added to the `Detached Repeat` element:

   * either by dragging the respective fields from the Document Model in the `Data Models View` onto the repeat. They will be displayed in the `Screens View` with a numbered prefix like "#2:"
     for the second element.
   * or by creating an `Expression Column` using the repeat’s context menu (see [Expressions](#txt:details:expression))

#### Embedded Repeat

`Embedded Repeats` can be seen as a hybrid of `Inline` and `Detached Repeats`.
They display repeatable data in the overview table in a read-only fashion just like `Detached Repeats`.

[Embedded Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)](#fig:melies-Embedded-overview) shows the overview table of an `Embedded Repeat`.

![embedded preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/embedded-preview.png)

Figure 79. Embedded Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)

However, when the user clicks to edit a set of data an editable row is shown which allows modification of the values of that data set. The editable row offers a Close button to close the row again, as well as all Row Action buttons for this *Repeat*.

![edit embedded preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/edit-embedded-preview.png)

Figure 80. Open Editable Row of an Embedded Repeat in the User Interface (Preview)

The content of the editable row is a `Control Grid` that is automatically created together with the `Embedded Repeat` and which cannot be removed.
This means that nesting is not possible with this type of *Repeats* since `Control Grids` cannot contain `Screens`, `Sections`, or further `Repeats`.

![screen view embedded](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/screen-view-embedded.png)

Figure 81. Screen View With an Embedded Repeat

#### Add and Edit a Repeat

* **Add:**
  Initially you have to create an `Inline Repeat`. `Detached Repeats` and `Embedded Repeats` cannot be created on their own.

  + Just drag & drop a repeatable group from the Document Model in the `Data Models View` onto the `Screens View`. An `Inline Repeat` named `{NameOfGroup}_Repeat` is
    shown in the `Screens View`. This name can be changed.
* **Edit:**
  Once you have created a `Repeat`, it appears in the `Screens View`. By clicking on it, a view with all properties appears. Now you can edit your `Repeat`.

  + To convert the *Repeat* type the user has to open the context menu of the *Repeat* and select the corresponding action inside the `Convert` section. The `Repeat` will automatically be converted to the selected type.
  + For `Detached Repeats`, a `Detail Screen` will be created automatically.
  + For `Embedded Repeats`, the `Control Grid` of the editable row will be created automatically.
  + When converting from `Embedded` or `Detached Repeats` to `Inline Repeats`, only the columns will be reused.
    The remaining content is discarded, after a confirmation warning was shown.
  + When converting from `Detached` to `Embedded Repeats`, the cells of all `Control Grids` on the details screen will be reused in the `Control Grid` of the `Embedded Repeat`.
    The remaining content, including the `Control Grids` and their rows, are discarded, after a confirmation warning was shown.
  + Columns that refer to a field from an attachment group, will be automatically set to read-only with the read-only presentation "Text Output" when converting to an `Inline Repeat`.

![repeat properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/repeat-properties.png)

Figure 82. Repeat Properties

#### Repeat Settings

Type
:   Type of the repeat (`Detached`, `Embedded` or `Inline`). This can be changed in the context menu as described in [Add and Edit a Repeat](#subsec:add-edit-repeat)

Repeatable Group Path
:   Path of the repeatable group from the Document Model. This is not editable.

Name
:   Name of the repeat in `Screens View`.

Enable Columns Resize
:   Enable the resizing of *Repeat* columns. If this feature is checked, then the width of columns in this *Repeat* will not be stretched, except for the last column in the non-pinned area, which will take the remaining space.

Initial Sorting
:   This property specifies the sorting of the repeat columns. More about the Sorting and Filtering of columns is explained
    in [Column Settings, Filtering and Sorting in Repeats](#subsec:filter-sort-repeat)

Initial Rows
:   When editing an `Inline Repeat` you can define how many initial rows (None, 1-10) should be displayed for this Repeat when it is initially created. These initial rows will be filled with the initial values of the *Repeat* columns. Therefore, all rows will be initialized with the same values. If initial rows are defined for a nested `Inline Repeat`, these rows will be created as soon as a new row is added to the parent *Repeat*. They will not be created upon document creation.

    The modeler needs to make sure that the initial rows of a *Repeat* are aligned with the validation of the model - for example, the number of initial rows should not exceed the maximum repeatability of the underlying group.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | The number of initial rows can only be defined for `Inline Repeats` and will be saved for the underlying group of the *Repeat*. Therefore, this setting affects all *Repeats* referencing this group. If a number of initial rows are set for a group, it is not allowed to have a `Detached/Embedded Repeat` that references the same group.  Converting an `Inline Repeat` to a `Detached/Embedded Repeat` will automatically remove the number of initial rows from the group configuration as long as no other `Inline Repeat` references the same group. |

Read-only
:   Sets a repeat to read-only. All data cannot be edited or added because the "Add"-button will be hidden.

Readonly Presentation
:   Defines the read-only presentation for field columns in an `Inline Repeat`. This setting can be overwritten for individual columns in the corresponding column dialog.

    * **Default**: Uses the read-only presentation defined in the model. If no presentation is defined in the model, it renders read-only inputs for the columns that are read-only.
    * **Input**: Renders a read-only input field for columns, which are readonly.
    * **Text Output**: Renders plain text for columns, which are readonly.

      The read-only functionality for *Repeats* is just to display repeatable
      data structures for information purposes. Additionally, a "view" icon for
      `Detached Repeats` replaced the "edit" icon. The "view" icon is representing a square with an arrow pointing to the top right and can be seen in [Read-Only Repeat With "View" Icon](#fig:chapter03:readonly-detached). This view button opens a non-editable
      `Detail Screen` with the existing data entries.

      ![detached readonly](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/detached-readonly.png)

      Figure 83. Read-Only Repeat With "View" Icon

      ![detail screen readonly](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/detail-screen-readonly.png)

      Figure 84. Details Screen of Detached Repeat After Clicking the "View" Icon

##### Repeat Entries

Here you will find some row actions that come predefined for general actions:

* `Add`
* `Remove`
* `Reorder`
* `Copy`

Checked row actions will be displayed in the Form Engine.

Selecting "Reorder" for a repeat will also enable the drag-and-drop feature, allowing you to move rows inside the repeat by dragging them to a new place.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can only use `Copy` when `Add` is also selected. |

![repeat buttons](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/repeat-buttons.png)

Figure 85. Buttons for a Row in a Repeatable Structure

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When using a filter expression the reorder button is hidden, since the shown data is only a subset of the real data in the document. Reordering (using the buttons or by dragging) does not work with filter expression! The same is true when using normal filters or sorting. |

##### Row Actions

In addition to the Repeat Entries, you can specify customized Row Actions, that is, actions affecting the data displayed in the corresponding *Repeat* row, which are not covered by the entries `Add, Remove, Reorder, Copy`.

A new custom Row Action with a customized icon can be created by clicking on the `Add` button within the `Row Actions` section.

![add row action](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/add-row-action.png)

Figure 86. Add Row Action for Repeat

###### Button Functions

In this section the functionality of the Row Action button can be defined.

Event
:   Name of the event that is triggered by the button.

Scope
:   Row Action buttons can be set to be hidden or disabled, depending on the read-only state of the form. By default, Row Action buttons will always be shown and enabled. Therefore `Always` will be pre-selected when creating a new Row Action.

    * `Always`: The button will always be shown and enabled.
    * `Disable Button in Edit Mode`: The button will be disabled if the form is in edit mode, that is, not set to `read-only`.
    * `Disable Button in Readonly Mode`: The button will be disabled if the form is in `read-only` mode.
    * `Hide Button in Edit Mode`: The button will be hidden if the form is in edit mode.
    * `Hide Button in Readonly Mode`: The button will be hidden if the form is in `read-only` mode.

Confirmation title (Multilingual)
:   When the Row Action requires a confirmation by the user, the title of the confirmation dialog can be defined here.

Confirmation message (Multilingual)
:   Message shown in the confirmation dialog.

    ![custom row action](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/custom-row-action.png)

    Figure 87. Customized Row Action in Repeat

###### Visual Settings

All Row Action buttons are displayed as `Secondary` and *non-*`Destructive` per default and will appear as a blue text link. This default value can be changed in the `Visual Settings` section.

Priority
:   Sets the style of the button to either `Secondary` or `Primary`.

Destructive
:   Sets the color of the Row Action button. `Destructive` buttons are displayed in red.

Icon
:   The icon representation is the recommended way for Row Action buttons in order to save space.

    An icon picker allows selecting the available icons. Different icon themes are available. Consult the [A12 Widgets documentation](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/general/icon#themes).

Hide Label
:   The label of the button can be hidden with the hide label option.

    This will only visually hide the defined label, but the label is still available for accessibility tools.

    For accessibility reasons and since it is used in the context menu of the repeat row, you should always provide a label for the button.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | If you want to hide the label of a Row Action button, you need to provide an icon. |

Label
:   For accessibility reasons and also since it is shown in the context menu entry, you should always provide a label for the Row Action.

###### Description

A multilingual description of the Row Action. If set, it is used in a tooltip when hovering over the Row Action button. It is also available for accessibility tools, for example, contained in the text read by screen readers.

##### Default Row Action

Event
:   You can specify which row action should be executed when a user clicks on a `Detached` or `Embedded Repeat` row by selecting an action from the drop-down. The drop-down will show an entry for:

    * "Edit/View"
    * "Download" if multi-file upload is enabled for the repeat (see [Multi File Upload](#subsubsec:repeat:multi-file-upload))
    * All row actions you created which do not specify a confirmation message

      "Edit/View" will open the row in an editable or read-only mode depending on the *Repeat* and the engine state. "Download" will automatically trigger a download of the attachment associated with the *Repeat* row.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | The default Row Action event will not be triggered if the user clicks on an interactive element in the corresponding row such as Row Action buttons or attachment inputs. A click on such elements will trigger the action of that element instead. |

Hide Button
:   You can decide whether the corresponding Row Action button should be hidden in the action column and in the context menu of the *Repeat*.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | It is recommended to hide the additional Row Action button to make your application accessible. Otherwise, screen readers will read the same action twice when using tab navigation. |

##### Table Size

You can specify whether pagination or infinite scrolling should be used to display a repeat table. Furthermore, additional settings can be made to configure the size of the rows and the Action column:

Pagination
:   If no infinite scrolling should be used, but your *Repeat* list is getting too large, you can provide a page size to enable pagination.

Page Size
:   The Page Size value defines after how many entries the page
    break is triggered. This is even provided for *Repeats* that are set to
    read-only. The pagination will be adapted when filtering and sorting.

    ![repeat pagination](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/repeat-pagination.png)

    Figure 88. Repeats With Pagination

    For detailed information about the `Detached Repeat` or the `Inline Repeat` read
    chapters [Detached Repeats](#subsec:details:detached-repeat) and
    [Inline Repeats](#subsec:details:inline-repeat)

Infinite scrolling
:   As an alternative to pagination you can also use infinite scrolling by enabling this check box. With infinite scrolling enabled, the content of the *Repeat* appears as a list that can be scrolled from the first to the last entry.

    ![infinite scrolling](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/infinite-scrolling.png)

    Figure 89. Infinite Scrolling Properties

    When infinite scrolling is enabled, you also need to set the height of the table to a fixed value:

Table Height in px
:   The height of the *Repeat* table in pixels. This setting must be set if you use infinite scrolling, otherwise, it is optional.

Row Height in px
:   The height of the *Repeat* table row in pixels. This setting must be set if you use infinite scrolling, otherwise, it is optional. Infinite scrolling can only be used without issues if the *Repeat* rows have a fixed height.

    You need to define this height to fit best to the type of cells you have. As an example, `Expressions` with multiline output or
    string fields with the area exposition need more space than a single line input `Control`.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Setting the row height to a value that is smaller than the minimum required value may lead to rendering issues. It is recommended to check this setting in the production environment to avoid these issues. |

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | The following values show the minimal required height for single line inputs based on the used Widgets theme:  * Default: 33px * Compact: 29px * Flat: 49px * Flat Compact: 29px |

Action column width
:   Defines the width of the action column in which the row actions (for example, delete, copy, or custom actions) are shown. You only need to set the property if you use infinite scrolling and the number of row actions differs between the rows (for example, because there are dynamically hidden or shown). With infinite scrolling, the repeat table does not access all rows at once and thus cannot calculate the maximum width of the action cell to avoid a size change of the column while scrolling. The width can be defined by setting a value of at least `0.3`. Steps of `0.1` can be used.
    When using the default plasma styling, `1.0` is equivalent to 150 pixels. Accordingly, a width of `0.5` is equivalent to 75 pixels and `2.5` is equivalent to 375 pixels.

Card Height in px
:   The height of a card (when configuring the Form Engine for card view) in pixels. This setting is only applied if you enable the card view in the configuration of the Form Engine and will overwrite the row height in that case.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Infinite scrolling can only be used without issues if the *Repeat* rows have a fixed height. Therefore, infinite scrolling is not allowed for `Embedded Repeats`, because its expandable rows can dynamically change their height.  Furthermore, with infinite scrolling enabled, you should use "Validation messages as tooltips" for your columns to assure a fixed row height. |

##### Multi File Upload

Multi-file upload can be enabled for `Embedded Repeats` and `Inline Repeats` if the underlying repeatable group contains exactly one attachment group, which has to be non-repeatable and is not nested in an additional repeatable group. If the multi-file upload is enabled for a *Repeat*, a file upload area will be rendered above the repeat table, where users can upload multiple files at once. Similar to other attachment inputs, files can either be picked in a file picker dialog after clicking the upload area or they can be added via drag and drop.

For every successfully uploaded file a *Repeat* row, containing the respective attachment, will be automatically added. When a user tries to upload a file with a name that already exists, a dialog will be shown to decide if the file should be skipped, replaced, or uploaded as a copy with a modified name.

![multi file upload repeat](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/multi-file-upload-repeat.png)

Figure 90. Repeat With Multi File Upload Enabled

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | An attempt to upload more files, than the repeatability allows, will result in an error message. |

The following additional settings are available if the multi-file upload is enabled:

![multi file settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/multi-file-settings.png)

Figure 91. Multi File Upload Settings

Attachment Group
:   The path to the attachment group in the Document Model. This path will be automatically set in the Form Model Editor and cannot be changed.

Show Download Button in Row Action
:   Shows a download Row Action button. Just like any other Row Action, this button will be rendered in the action column and in the context menu of the *Repeat*. Clicking the button triggers the download of the attachment that is associated with the current *Repeat* row.

Description
:   A localized text that will be shown inside the upload area.

Hide Description
:   If the description should not be shown, it can be visually hidden via this setting. It will still be available for accessibility tools.

Button Text
:   The localized label of the upload button.

Hide Button Text
:   If the button text should not be shown, it can be visually hidden via this setting. It will still be available for accessibility tools.

Helper Text
:   A localized helper text that will be shown below the upload area.

Accepted MIME Types
:   With the accept property you can provide a comma-separated list of MIME types that should be accepted by inputs for this attachment group (for example, image/jpeg, video/\*, application/msword, …​).

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | It is important to note that this will not actually restrict the file types that can be uploaded by the user but only affects the file types that are initially suggested to the user when opening the file upload dialog. |

##### Filter Expression

All repeats support a filtering of the rows that are displayed. By doing this, different views on the same underlying repeatable
group can be provided. For example, when editing a repeatable group containing both foreign and domestic addresses, one *Repeat* could filter for foreign and another for domestic address rows.

Since Filter Expressions could be seen as a subset of [Expressions](#txt:details:expression) the syntax for them is similar.

* In order to specify a `Filter Expression` for a *Repeat*, first open its
  detail view (click on the model element in the `Screens View`). Then fill in a filter rule in the field `Filter Expression`. A *Repeat* can only be filtered by a single field’s value.

  + Example for a string field with the name "Country". This will list
    only the data entries in which the field `Country` equals `DE`.
    `[Country] = "DE"`
  + Example for group scope for an `Enumeration` field with the name
    "NumberEnum" defined in the group "MyFieldGroup":
    `kontext(MyFieldGroup) { [NumberEnum] } = "THREE"`
  + Example for the nested group:
    `kontext(TopGroup){ kontext(SubGroup) {[Date]}} = "2018-05-25"`

##### Accessibility

*Repeats* support accessibility by having their label programmatically connected to their table. This, for example, allows screen readers to read the label of the table.

Hide Label
:   If the design of the web form requires that the label of a *Repeat* shouldn’t be visible, it can be hidden with the 'Hide Label' option. This will only visually hide the defined label but still keep it available for accessibility tools.

Screen Reader Column
:   By default, row action labels in repeat rows will only contain their event name (like "delete" or "edit"). To allow screen readers to provide context about a specific row, this property can be used.
    If set, the value of the cell (defined by the current row and the given column) will be available for screen readers.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The intention of this feature is that screen readers can read a "unique" text for row actions that would otherwise have a generic one that is not distinguishable between different rows (for example, the delete action). Since the uniqueness is achieved by reading the cell value in addition to the action text, it is therefore not recommended to use columns of type Expression (as these might contain HTML markup) or types that have a very limited set of values (like a Boolean column) |

#### Column Settings, Filtering and Sorting in Repeats

For all *Repeat* types, you can change some column properties like its icon, width, filtering, and sorting.

1. Double click on a repeatable field
2. Go to `Column Settings`

![column settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/column-settings.png)

Figure 92. Column Settings of a Repeatable Field

An icon can be specified in the `Column Settings` of each field. This icon will be shown in the *Repeat* table head,
together with the column label. Additionally, `Hide Label` can be selected. In this case, only the icon - if specified
- will be displayed in the *Repeat* table head. Note that hiding the label and not specifying a label text are not the same. The hidden label will still be part of the form to provide accessibility.

Furthermore, the `Column Width` can be defined by setting a value of at least `0.3`. Steps of `0.1` can be used. The default setting for the column width is `1.0`. When using the default plasma styling, `1.0` is equivalent to 150 pixels. Accordingly, a width of 0.5 is equivalent to 75 pixels and 2.5 is equivalent to 375 pixels.

For non-pinned columns, the value defines a minimum width if the option `Fixed Width` is not set. If there is more space available, all non-pinned columns will grow proportionally according to their width ratio. If the option `Fixed Width` is set, then the column will not stretch.

For pinned columns, the value defines a fixed width. Pinned columns will not grow if more space is available. For more details, consult the Table widget documentation of the Widgets team.

Furthermore, the `Filterable` and `Sortable` options can be configured within this field setting:

Filterable
:   Filterable is available for all data types except attachments. If there is at least one filterable column in a repeat, a button is going to be available to open/close the filter section. A color change of the button indicates an active filter.

    ![filtering preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/filtering-preview.png)

    Figure 93. Filtering in Preview

    The type of input displayed in the filter section depends on the data type of the column.

Filter Exposition
:   If `filterable` has been activated for an Enumeration or an External Enumeration, the exposition used to display the filter input can be adjusted via the `Filter Exposition` property. The default exposition for an Enumeration is `FULL`, meaning that all available options are going to be displayed as a checkbox group. For an External Enumeration the default exposition is `STRING`, meaning that a text input is going to be displayed where you can enter a filter value.

Sortable
:   Sortable is available for all data types except attachments and multi-selects. It supports ascending and descending, and is triggered by clicking on a sortable column header. The chosen column header shows the sorting state with a solid black triangle icon.

Preferred sorting
:   Specifies the initial sorting direction after sorting is triggered for this column. Sorting the column in the other direction can still be achieved by clicking the column header again.

    ![sorting preview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/sorting-preview.png)

    Figure 94. Sorting in Preview

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | The rows of a *Repeat* will be immediately filtered and sorted again when a value in one of the rows is changed. In `Inline/Embedded Repeats` this might lead to unexpected behavior if filtering or sorting is active while editing a row:  * Filtering: The row might be filtered out and will therefore disappear from the `Screen`. * Sorting: If pagination is used for the `Inline/Embedded Repeat`, the row might be sorted to a different page and will therefore disappear from the `Screen`.  While adding a new row, this row is excluded from filtering/sorting and will therefore not be affected by the described behavior. |

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | There is some special behavior when filtering and sorting lists of dates that contain partially known dates. In this case the partially known dates will be converted to a full date where the missing parts of the date are taken from "1970-01-01". This is only done for the UI - no data will be altered. Examples:  * "2021-08-00" becomes "2021-08-01" * "2021-00-00" becomes "2021-01-01" * "0000-00-00" becomes "1970-01-01" |

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | When filtering fields of type DateRange, for which the property `interpretationOfYear` is defined, it is not possible to use open ranges. For such fields, the start and end values are required, because the year of the start date depends on the end date or vice versa. |

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Leading zeros will be ignored when sorting or filtering numbers with them (for example, 0042).  Example for sorting: Having three rows with the following number values:  * Row 1: 042 * Row 2: 12 * Row 3: 0099  Sorting them in ascending order will result in the following order:  * Row 2: 12 * Row 1: 042 * Row 3: 0099  Furthermore, when entering a number with leading zeros into a number filter field the leading zeros will be stripped from the input. |

Pin Direction
:   defines if a certain column will be pinned to the left or right side of the table. Scrolling will happen between pinned columns.

The column order will be changed in the editor automatically. A Column that gets pinned to the left will be moved to the top and right-pinned columns to the bottom of the list. Unpinning does not change the order. Every pinned column gets marked with a black triangle specifying the pin direction.

##### Alignment

Alignments can be set independently for header and content cells of a *Repeat* column.

![alignment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/alignment.png)

Figure 95. Alignment of Columns

For horizontal alignment the following options are available:

* `Default`
* `Left`
* `Center`
* `Right`

For vertical alignment the available options are

* `Default`
* `Top`
* `Middle`
* `Bottom`

When setting the alignment to `Default`, the default alignment will be used. The default alignment is determined according to the data type of the corresponding Document Model element, the repeat type, the cell type (Header/Content) and the presence of an `Expression` column in this *Repeat*:

|  | Default | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Horizontal | `Right` | All columns with data type Number |
|  | `Left` | In all other cases |
| Vertical | `Top` | For content cells of `Inline Repeats` that contain no expression column |
|  | `Middle` | In all other cases |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When a specific horizontal alignment is set only for the body, the head alignment will receive it by default as well. |

##### Additional Settings

Summary Row
:   For all columns of type number, a summary row can be modeled by clicking the checkbox "Show summary". The summary row will be displayed at the bottom of the repeat table if there is at least one valid input in the column. If a suffix is modeled, it will be shown after the sum.

    |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | Because the sum is formatted via Kernel, it is limited to 15 (significant) digits. If the sum exceeds this limit because of fractional digits, it will be rounded. If the sum exceeds the upper/lower bound, a placeholder will be shown instead. Refer to the [Kernel documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html#Number_attributep) for more information about the number type. |

    ![summary row](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/summary-row.png)

    Figure 96. Summary Row for Number Column

#### Expressions for Repeats

A short introduction on how to create an expression in a repeat. For detailed information, see [Expressions](#txt:details:expression).

* right click on a `Repeat`
* select the menu item `Expression` from the context menu

The `Expressions` will be displayed at the end of the *Repeat* list/overview and has the suffix `(Expr)` to its name.

Similar to field columns, an icon can be specified for each `Expression Column`. This icon will be shown in the *Repeat*
table head, together with the column label. Additionally, `Hide Label` can be selected. In this case, only the icon - if specified - will be displayed in the repeat table head. Note that hiding the label and not specifying a label text are not the same. The hidden label will still be part of the form to provide accessibility.

#### Button Labels

You can edit the multilingual labels and confirmation texts of all *Repeat* buttons
according to the locales used in the current Form Model. The title and message of the modal shown when removing a *Repeat* row can be configured in the "Remove Confirmation" section from `Edit Repeat > Button Labels`.

### Dependencies

The Form Model Editor supports different model elements for advanced specifications concerning dependencies and configurational elements that can be applied to `Controls`, `Fields`, or `Groups`. This chapter takes a closer look at each type of `Dependency`.

#### Dependency Editing

To create, edit, or delete a dependency, click the "Data Configuration" tab in the sidebar. There, the tree of the Document Model elements is shown for which you can apply dependencies. Existing dependencies will be visualized in the tree with icons behind the elements: A "D" symbolizes an element that is dependent on another, while a "T" symbolizes that the element is used as the master in a dependency.

#### Dependent Field

The `Dependent Field` feature allows setting a field’s property based on another field’s value. The field that is being controlled is called the `Dependent Field`. The controlling field is called the `Master Field`.

A `Field Dependency` can be defined for all fields except value fields of Multi-Select groups.

The dependent field configuration can be created/removed as follows:

1. Click on the field to be made dependent in the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view).
2. In the newly opened form under the tab "Dependencies", click the button "Set Dependent Field" to create a new dependency.
3. A table displaying all available trigger values will be visible, and the master field can be changed by using the drop-down menu above the table.
4. Removing an existing dependency can be done by clicking the "Remove Dependent Field" button below the table.

Clicking the Apply button in the bottom right will save your changes in the Form Model and close the editor form.

![form dependent field](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/form-dependent-field.png)

Figure 98. Dialog to Edit a Dependent Field

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `Dependent Field` feature is always applied to the underlying data field. For example, if you use the same field both on an edit and on a summary Screen, the `Dependency` will be effective on both Screens. |

[Dialog to Edit a Dependent Field](#fig:formmodel:form-dependent-field) shows the dialog for editing
field-wise dependencies. In that example, whenever a selection has been
made on the `ContactType` master field, the `Dependent Field` will be
cleared by setting an empty value. For each selected trigger value, the
following options are available:

Display Column:

* **Default:** Does not change the `Dependent Field`.
* **Not Relevant:** Hides the `Dependent Field` from the form view and ignores it in form validation and computation. The field value will not be saved.
* **Read Only:** Sets the `Dependent Field` to read-only. If this field is required, the asterisk will not be shown.

Value Column:

* **Unchanged:** Does not change the `Dependent Field`.
* **Value:** Writes the given value into the `Dependent Field`. This value
  can only be set once the checkbox in the trigger value column has been activated.
  For dependent fields of certain data types, the value can be entered into a plain input. In this case, the same data formats as for initial values apply. See [Initial Value](#txt:detail:InitialValue) for more details.
  For computed dependent fields, a value cannot be set since it would conflict with the computation.
* **Field Value:** Takes the value of the selected field and writes it in
  the `Dependent Field`. All available fields are listed in a drop-down
  menu. This value can only be set once the checkbox in the trigger value column has been activated.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A field can only be selected for the field value if it has the same data type as the `Dependent Field`. However, it is important to note that the fields are not checked for compatibility based on Data Type Configuration or Validation Rules within the Document Model. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The value effects of a Dependency are only evaluated and applied when the value of the trigger field changes as a result of a manual change of a form input or of adding or removing a repeat row. See [Dependency Evaluation](#txt:details:dependency-evaluation) for more details.  For example, the Dependency in [Example of a Dependent Field](#fig:formmodel:form-dependent-field-2) means that the value of *PrimaryContact* is set to the value of the field *TelephoneNumber* if, in the input of the trigger field *ContactType*, the entry "Telephone Number" is chosen. The value of *PrimaryContact* will not be updated when the value of the field TelephoneNumber changes, as long as the trigger value is not deselected and selected again. |

![form dependent field2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/form-dependent-field2.png)

Figure 99. Example of a Dependent Field

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If the `Dependent Field` is located inside a repeatable group, then the following restrictions apply:  The master field must be located in the same repeatable group or in a group on a higher level above it. This is due to the fact that one master field data instance can control read-only and not relevant for many `Dependent Field` data instances but one `Dependent Field` data instance must be uniquely controlled by one master field data instance. Otherwise, configurations would be ambiguous. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Combining multiple dependencies (for example, `Dependent Field` and `Dependent Enumeration`) can result in unexpected behavior. See [Combining Multiple Dependencies](#txt:details:combining-multiple-dependencies) for details. |

##### Default Values for Dependent Fields

There is one feature worth mentioning here regarding the interplay of
`Dependent Fields` with their default values. Consider the situation shown in [Dependent Field "contactMisc"](#fig:formmodel:form-dependent-field-default-value).

The field labeled *Miscellaneous* defaults to *phone number known* when
*Telephone Number* is selected as a *contactType*. If in the next step
*Twitter Account* is selected as *contactType*, the field
*Miscellaneous* will be hidden due to being marked as `Not Relevant`. Finally, making no selection on the
*contactType* makes the field *Miscellaneous* visible again. It will
still be filled with the text *phone number known* from before.

![contactMisc](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/contactMisc.png)

Figure 100. Dependent Field "contactMisc"

So no resetting of the field takes place when it is set to `Not Relevant`. It is good
practice to set up default values for `Dependent Fields` in the way just
described. This works more elaborately compared to just defining an initial value for the corresponding field.

#### Dependent Group

`Dependent Groups` are similar to `Dependent Fields`, but they work on a
group level. They can be used to hide (via `not relevant`) or show all fields placed in a
group and the group itself based on the value of a master field for example.

To create/remove a `Dependent Group`:

1. Click any group in the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view).
2. You can set a new dependency by clicking "Set Dependent Group".
3. Select a *Master Field*. Only `Enumeration`, `Boolean` and `Confirmation` fields are
   allowed as master fields.
4. Select the trigger values for which you want to define the dependent
   group’s state. In case of `Boolean` master fields, there are three trigger
   values: `-No Selection-`, `false` and `true`. In case of `Enumerations`, all
   predefined `Enumeration` values and `-No Selection-` are listed as
   possible trigger values.
5. Define the desired state for each activated trigger value.
6. Removing an existing dependency can be done by clicking the "Remove Dependent Group" button below the table.

![dependent group](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/dependent-group.png)

Figure 101. View to Edit a Dependent Group

The [View to Edit a Dependent Group](#fig:formmodel:form-edit-dependentgroup) shows an example of the dialog for editing group-wise dependencies. For each selected trigger value, the following options are available:

Display Column:

* **Not Relevant:** Hides the `Dependent Group` and all of its fields from the form view and ignores them in form validation and computation. The `Dependent Group` will not be saved.
* **R/O:** Sets all fields of the `Dependent Group` to read-only. This condition is also set for all members of the `Detached Repeat Detail Screen`. As a consequence, if your trigger field is part of the `Detached Repeat Detail Screen`, setting it to read-only inside the Screen will disable the possibility to change back. Likewise, if you enter the Screen with read-only enabled, you cannot disable it from inside the Screen.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The described behavior of the read-only status to affect all members of the `Detached Repeat Detail Screen` does not happen for the not relevant status of the `Dependent Group`. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `Dependent Group` feature has been introduced mainly for comfort. Instead of defining the same dependency for each field in a group, you can define a dependency for all fields in a group directly on group-level. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The groups of attachment and multi-select elements can be `Dependent Groups`. |

#### Dependent Enumeration

`Dependent Enumerations` allow you to filter `Enumeration` subsets depending
on the value of another `Enumeration` which is called the *master enumeration*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that the "Set Dependent Enumeration" button will only be visible if the clicked field is enumeration-like (so either an `Enumeration` field or a field with a Type Definition based on `Enumeration`). Furthermore, `Dependent Enumerations` are not supported for the value field of Multi-Selects. |

The following listing shows how to set up this element.

1. Click on the field in the [Data Configuration View](#txt:editor:data-configuration-view) which is supposed to
   become a `Dependent Enumeration`.
2. In the newly opened form under the tab "Dependencies", click on the button "Set Dependent Enumeration" to create a new dependency.
3. A table displaying all available trigger values will be visible and the master field can be changed by using the drop-down menu above the table
4. In the example shown, the enumeration *MasterEnumeration* is set as the trigger value. Note that only Controls for fields of type
   enumeration are listed in the drop-down menu.
5. Removing an existing `Dependent Enumeration` can be done by clicking the "Remove Dependent Enumeration" button below the table.

In the example shown in [Editor to Define a Dependent Enumeration](#fig:melies-edit-dep-enumeration), the following behavior of the field *DependentField* is defined:

* Trigger value (not its text) *MASTER\_1* selected:
  *DEPENDENT\_1*, *DEPENDENT\_4*, and *DEPENDENT\_5* and the empty selection will be selectable in the dependent enumeration. The dependent enumeration field is set to *DEPENDENT\_1* on the master field change.
* Trigger value *MASTER\_2* selected:
  *DEPENDENT\_2*, *DEPENDENT\_4*, and
  *DEPENDENT\_5* and the empty selection will be selectable in the
  dependent enumeration. The dependent enumeration field is cleared on the master field change.
* Trigger value *MASTER\_3* selected:
  *DEPENDENT\_3*, *DEPENDENT\_4*, and *DEPENDENT\_5* and the empty selection will be selectable in the
  dependent enumeration. The dependent enumeration field is set to *DEPENDENT\_5* on the master field change.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * If there is an empty selection done on the master enumeration, then all values of the `Dependent Enumeration` become selectable. Furthermore, the empty selection is always possible in the `Dependent Field`. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Combining multiple dependencies (for example, `Dependent Field` and `Dependent Enumeration`) can result in unexpected behavior. See [Combining Multiple Dependencies](#txt:details:combining-multiple-dependencies) for details. |

![dependent enumerations](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/dependent-enumerations.png)

Figure 102. Editor to Define a Dependent Enumeration

#### Dependent Controls

`Dependent Controls` only serve to hide or show entire blocks (Screen elements), that is, `Control Grids`, `Sections`, `Multi-Column Sections` or `Custom Screen Elements`. Everything concerning fields should be done via [Dependent Field](#subsec:details:dependent-fields). In contrast to the other `Dependencies`, `Dependent Controls` are added from the [Screens View](#txt:editor:screen-view). Other than that, the user flow is the same.

* **Add a `Dependent Control`**:
  When clicking a Form Model `Control` of type `Boolean`, `Confirm` or `Enumeration`, the opened editor form will include a dependency tab, where a `Dependent Control` can be added, edited or removed. To add dependent elements to a specific trigger value, click it and choose elements from the tree modal. Note that you can resize the modal by dragging its borders.

![dependent control settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/dependent-control-settings.png)

Figure 104. Select a Control From the Dialog

After completion of the `Dependent Control` the elements in the `Screens View` gets marked.

![dependent control flags](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/dependent-control-flags.png)

Figure 105. Marked Dependent Controls With Mouse Over Hint

The trigger control is marked with a colored T flag behind its name. Dependent elements are mark with a colored D flag.

* To edit an existing `Dependent Control` configuration:

  1. click on the `Control` in the `Screens View`
  2. navigate to `Dependencies > Dependent Control`
  3. click on the trigger value whose Controls shall be changed
* To remove an existing `Dependent Control` configuration:

  1. follow the same steps 1 and 2 from above on how to edit an existing `Dependent Control`
  2. click on `Remove Dependent Controls` button

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A dependent Screen element must be controlled by exactly one instance of the trigger field. Therefore, it is not allowed to select Screen elements, that are placed in a data context outside of the context of the trigger field. Consider the following example:  1. Document Model with a non-repeatable field *F0* and a repeatable group *G1* with a field *F1*. 2. Form Model with a Detached Repeat for group *G1* and a Control for *F1* on its Detail Screen.  Then it would not be allowed to define a Control dependency on the Control for *F1*, that references a Screen element outside of the Detached Repeat Detail Screen, because it is not uniquely defined which instance of *F1* should be used to evaluate the dependency.  In contrast, a Control dependency from a Control for field *F0* to a Screen element on the Detached Repeat Detail Screen would be valid. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Control dependencies on indexed Controls cannot be defined across repeatability levels. This means, that an indexed Control may only reference Screen elements on the same (Detail) Screen, that are not further nested in an Embedded Repeat or Detached Repeat. |

#### Dependency Evaluation

Dependencies can have effects on the display state of form content on the one hand, *hidden* (via not relevant) and *readonly*, and on the values of form fields on the other hand.

In the editors of the Dependent Field and Dependent Group dependencies, these two effect categories are represented by the two columns in the dependency tables.

Dependent Enumeration dependencies only have a value effect or an effect on the available enumeration options.

Dependent Control dependencies only have a display state effect.

These different kinds of effects are evaluated and applied to the form at different points in time.

Display state effects are evaluated and applied in the form during initialization, that is, right from the start, and when a trigger value of a dependency is changed in any way.

Value effects are only evaluated after the form was initialized. This means they are not evaluated during the initial computation and also not for initial values. Therefore, defining an initial value for a trigger field control doesn’t lead to the dependent field having the derived value initially.

Their evaluation only happens when the trigger value changes as a result of a user interaction with the form. This could simply be a direct change of the trigger input value. But the trigger could also be a computed field or a dependent field itself or even part of a chain of dependencies and computations. In this case, evaluation happens when an input of the computation / a transitive dependency trigger is changed manually. This can also happen by adding or removing repeat rows.

This default behavior can also be changed via the options described in [Preprocessing Settings](#txt:form:model-settings:pre-processing).

#### Combining Multiple Dependencies

Combining multiple dependencies can result in unwanted behavior for multiple reasons.

1. Dependencies are evaluated after each other and can therefore override each other.

   That is why a combination of `Dependent Field` and `Dependent Enumeration` on the same field should not be used.
2. Dependencies, which change the value of one or more fields, might trigger other dependencies and can therefore lead to cycles. Furthermore, such dependencies might trigger a re-calculation of computations that have been defined in the Document Model (for further information, refer to the [Document Modeling documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html)). Consequently, combining dependencies with computations can also lead to cycles.

   If a cyclic reference between any number of fields is detected, a consistency problem will be reported, which provides information about the affected fields, dependencies, and computations.

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | Even if your Form Model contains multiple cycles, the consistency problem will only contain information about the first detected cycle. Once this cycle has been resolved, the message will be updated accordingly and show information about the next remaining cycle. |

   Generally, the following combinations can lead to cycles:

   * `Dependent Field` for a field *F1* and a `Dependent Field`/`Enumeration`, which uses *F1* as trigger element
   * `Dependent Field` for a field *F1* and a `Computation`, which uses *F1* in its precondition or calculation
   * `Dependent Enumeration` for a field *F1* and a `Dependent Field`/`Enumeration`, which uses *F1* as trigger element
   * `Dependent Enumeration` for a field *F1* and a `Computation`, which uses *F1* in its precondition or calculation
   * `Computation` for a field *F1* and a `Dependent Field`/`Enumeration`, which uses *F1* as trigger element
   * `Computation` for a field *F1* and a `Computation`, which uses *F1* in its precondition or calculation

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The cycle detection will only consider if the value of a field depends on some other field, but not which specific value is set by the dependency or computation. In some cases this will detect cycles, which do not cause problems in the running application. Example:  * `Dependent Field` for field *F1*: If field *F3* is set to 1, set field *F1* to 1. * `Dependent Field` for field *F2*: If field *F1* is set to 1, set field *F2* to 1. * `Dependent Field` for field *F3*: If field *F2* is set to 1, set field *F3* to 2.  There is a cyclic reference between all three fields. However, the dependency for *F3* will not trigger the dependency for *F1*. |

### Conditionally Hidden Elements

In addition to the functionality provided by [Dependencies](#txt:form:dependencies), most Form Model elements can be conditionally hidden based on the value of some field instance in the document.

Unlike Dependencies, that allow marking fields as "not relevant" and remove their values, conditionally hidden elements preserve their data in the document. It is purely a visual hiding mechanism that does not affect the underlying document data. Each form element evaluates its hide condition independently, and the hiding takes effect immediately when the form is displayed.

The field from the Document Model used in the `Hide Condition` can be of type Boolean, Confirm or Enumeration. Since computed fields are supported as well, the condition indirectly supports complex logic and the expressiveness of the Kernel Language.

One or more values of the `Hide Condition Field`, including the empty value, can be selected and when either of these values is present in the document, the element will be hidden.

This feature is similar to [Dependent Controls](#subsec:details:dependent-control), but more elements are supported and it is not necessary to add a Control for the Hide Condition Field to the Screen.

#### Modeling Conditionally Hidden Elements

To configure elements to be conditionally hidden, in the Form Model Editor:

1. Select the to be hidden Form Model element from the model tree and open its element editor.
2. In the element editor, locate and open the section "Hide Condition".
3. Choose a Hide Condition Field from the dropdown list. Only supported fields are available for selection. See [Supported Hide Condition Fields](#txt:form:supported-hide-condition-fields) for details.
4. Select the values of the Hide Condition Field, for which the element should be hidden. The empty value, "(no value)", is supported as well.

Figure 106. Hide Condition Section in the Element Editor

To remove the Hide Condition from an element, simply clear the Hide Condition Field selection in the element editor. This removes the values as well.

#### Limitations and Considerations

When using Hide Conditions on Repeat Columns, only the displayed data or the input are hidden, but not the entire column. This means that the column header remains visible and the column still takes space.

The same is true for Controls within Control Grids. When the Control is hidden, the displayed data or the input is hidden, including the label, but the hidden Control itself still takes space in the grid.

The following elements are currently excluded from having a Hide Condition:

* Screens
* Event and Navigation Buttons
* Repeat Row Actions and Buttons
* Embedded Repeat Control Grids - since these are an integral part of the Embedded Repeat
* Detached Repeat Detail Screens - since these are an integral part of the Detached Repeat

Note, that Event and Navigation Buttons as well as Repeat Row Actions can be hidden or disabled dynamically via the Form Engine’s Enablement programming API. See the [Form Engine documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle#form-engine_tutorials_button_enablement) for details.

| --- | --- |
|  | Conditionally hidden elements are still considered during the form validation and for computations. Validation rules need to take the visibility into account, so that the user is not blocked from saving the document due to invalid hidden elements. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Form Model Editor cannot prevent a model structure, where the last remaining Control for influencing the hidden state of a container element is placed somewhere within that container itself. This could lead to situations, where the user can hide but not un-hide the container element anymore.  Be cautious to avoid such structures in your Form Model. |

#### Influence on Validation and Computations

Since hiding an element via a Hide Condition has no influence on the underlying document data, this data is still considered in both computations and validation rules.

In contrast, when using DependentField and DependentGroup with "not relevant", the data is filtered out before executing validations. However, computations always include all data, regardless of whether elements are conditionally hidden or marked as "not relevant".

Whether a hidden element is considered in validation depends on the validation mode:

* **Full or field validation**: Hidden elements are validated, including formal validations. If a hidden element contains invalid data, the user will be blocked from saving.
* **Partial validation**: Only visible elements are validated. Hidden elements are excluded from these validation modes.

##### Recommendations

To prevent saving issues caused by invalid hidden elements, you should design your validation rules to take the visibility of elements into account. For example, you could use an inversion of the Hide Condition in the validation rule’s condition, so that the rule only applies when the element is visible.

If the hidden element’s data can be discarded on save, prefer using the "not relevant" feature of Dependencies instead of Hide Conditions, since the data is filtered out before validation then.

Be extra careful with computation rules, since here data from elements hidden via any hiding mechanism is still included. If you do not want to compute values of hidden elements, you need to include the visibility condition in the computation rule’s condition.

For a more detailed description of the form validation behavior, refer to the [Form Engine documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#form-engine_validation-computation_validation).

#### Supported Hide Condition Fields

A field from the Document Model can serve as a Hide Condition Field when it meets **both** of the following criteria: the field type and its position in the Document Model structure.

##### Field Type

The Hide Condition Field must be one of the following types:

* Boolean
* Confirm
* Enumeration
* Type Definition based on Boolean, Confirm, or Enumeration

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Since computed fields are also supported, you can use Kernel Language expressions to implement complex visibility logic. |

##### Document Structure Position

The Hide Condition Field instance must be uniquely identifiable in the context of the element to be hidden.
The following rules determine which fields are available:

**For elements outside any Repeat** (at the Form Model root level):

* Fields at the root level of the Document Model are available, that is, from all non-repeatable root groups and their non-repeatable descendant groups.

**For elements inside a Repeat**:

* Fields from the same repeatable Group that the Repeat references, and from deeper nested non-repeatable Groups within that repeatable Group, are available
* Fields from any ancestor Group in the path from the Document Model root to the Repeat’s Group are available
* Fields at the root level of the Document Model are available

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Form Model Editor’s dropdown only displays fields that are valid for the selected element’s position. If an expected field does not appear in the dropdown, verify that the field meets the type and position requirements described above. |

#### Overview in the Form Model Editor

Conditionally hidden elements are marked with a green indicator containing an "H" in the Form Model Editor’s model tree, so that they can be easily identified.

![hide condition indicator](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/hide-condition-indicator.png)

Figure 107. Hide Condition Indicator in the Form Model Editor element tree

When hovering over the indicator, a tooltip gives a summary of the Hide Condition.

![hide condition tooltip](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/assets/chapter03/hide-condition-tooltip.png)

Figure 108. Hide Condition Tooltip

#### Copying the Hide Condition

It is possible to copy the Hide Condition configuration from one element to another using the context menu actions "Copy Hide Condition" and "Paste Hide Condition" available on elements that support conditional hiding.

When copying, both the selected "Hide Condition" field and the selected values are copied. When pasting, an existing configuration of the target element is replaced only after confirmation. A currently open element editor will first be closed with dirty handling before pasting the Hide Condition.

A once copied Hide Condition can be pasted multiple times to different target elements.

It is not checked whether the Hide Condition Field is compatible for the target element. If it isn’t, the target element will become invalid and the error needs to be resolved manually.

Following keyboard shortcuts are available for the copy and paste actions:

* Copy Hide Condition: `Ctrl+H` / `Cmd+H`
* Paste Hide Condition: `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B`

#### Refactoring Support

When the experimental Form Model Refactoring feature is enabled in the Simple Model Editor, deleting the Hide Condition field from the Document Model will trigger a refactoring dialog that, next to changing to a different field, offers the option to remove the Hide Condition from all elements that reference the deleted field.

Refactoring for field type changes of the Hide Condition field is not supported. If the field type is changed to an unsupported type, the elements referencing that field in their Hide Condition will become invalid and must be corrected manually.

When the Hide Condition Field type is changed to a different supported type (for example, from Enumeration to Boolean), the Hide Condition configuration is preserved but may become invalid. The previously selected values might no longer be valid for the new field type. In such cases, all elements referencing this field must be manually reviewed and their Hide Condition values updated accordingly. Invalid values will be marked as such and there is an option to clear all invalid values at once.

### Comparison of Dependency Mechanisms

This chapter provides a comparative overview of the four mechanisms available in the Form Model for controlling visibility, editability, and values of form elements based on document field values.

#### Overview

The Form Model Editor supports four distinct mechanisms for reactive form behavior:

* `Dependent Field` - Controls a single field’s display state and value based on a master field.
* `Dependent Group` - Controls all fields within a group based on a master field.
* `Dependent Control` - Hides or shows entire screen-level blocks based on a master control.
* `Conditionally Hidden` - Visually hides most form elements based on a master field value, without affecting data.

#### Comparison of Mechanisms

| Aspect | Dependent Field | Dependent Group | Dependent Control | Conditionally Hidden |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Set a single field’s display and data relevancy state and/or static value or another field’s value based on a master field’s value. | Set the display and data relevancy state of all fields in a group and the group itself based on a master field’s value. | Hide or show entire screen-level blocks (structural elements) based on a master control’s value. | Visually hides most form elements based on a master field value, without affecting data. |

#### Common Aspects

All four mechanisms share the following characteristics:

* They use fields of type Boolean, Confirmation, or Enumeration as their master field.
* They support the empty value as a master condition.
* Display state effects are evaluated during form initialization and re-evaluated when the master value changes.
* They are configured within the Form Model Editor, not the Document Model Editor.
* Existing configurations are visually indicated in the editor tree views with dedicated icons

#### Unique Aspects

##### Dependent Field

* The only mechanism that can actively set or change field values (via the Value column: `Value` or `Field Value`).
* Provides three display states: `Default`, `Not Relevant`, and `Read Only`.
* Value effects by default are not evaluated during initial form loading - only after user interaction. But this can be changed via pre-processing settings.
* Applied at the data level, meaning the dependency is effective on all Screens where the dependent field is used and also for fields not used in the form.

##### Dependent Group

* Operates on the group level, controlling the group and all child fields at once - introduced mainly for convenience to avoid defining the same dependency on each individual field.
* The `Read Only` state propagates into `Detached Repeat Detail Screens`, which can lock users out of editing if the trigger field is inside the same Screen.
* Can be applied to attachment and multi-select element groups.

##### Dependent Control

* The only Dependency mechanism that is configured from the `Screens View` rather than the `Data Configuration View` or element editor.
* Requires the master field to have a `Control` placed on a `Screen`.
* Targets screen-level structural elements (`Control Grids`, `Sections`, `Multi-Column Sections`, `Custom Screen Elements`) rather than data fields or groups.
* Purely a display state mechanism with no impact on data values.

##### Conditionally Hidden

* Supports the broadest range of target elements (most Form Model elements).
* Does not require the condition field to have a Control on the Screen.
* Purely visual - hidden elements are still validated during a full validation and still participate in computations, values are not discarded on save, unlike "not relevant" dependencies.
* Provides copy/paste functionality with keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+H` / `Cmd+H`, `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B`).
* Uses a green "H" indicator in the editor tree, distinct from the "D"/"T" icons used by dependencies.

#### Choosing the Right Mechanism

| Use Case | Recommended Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Hide a Control, because its value is not needed anymore in the document, and you want to exclude it from validation and saving | Dependent Field (with display effect `Not Relevant`) |
| Make a single Control read-only based on a master field value | Dependent Field (with display effect `Read Only`) |
| Set a field’s value to another field’s value when a master field value is changed | Dependent Field (with value effect `Field Value`) |
| Make all Controls referencing fields of a certain group read-only at once | Dependent Group |
| Hide a Repeat including all its rows in the form, as it is not relevant any longer and you want to exclude all repeating group instances from validation and saving in the document | Dependent Group (with display effect `Not Relevant`) |
| Visually hide a structural screen element (Section, Control Grid) without affecting data | Conditionally Hidden |
| Visually hide a Control while preserving its data and keeping validation active | Conditionally Hidden |
| Visually hide a Section on a Screen based on a Control value, while showing another Section based on a different Control referencing the same Field as the first Control | Dependent Control |

#### Using Multiple Mechanisms Together

Modeling multiple mechanisms for the same Element does not lead to an error but modelers must take care when setting the condition.

An Element will be hidden when either a Hide Condition matches or it is not relevant according to a Field or Group Dependency or a Dependent Control condition does *not* match.

This means that if the conditions of multiple mechanisms are combined on the same element, they are evaluated with an OR logic.

## Refactoring

The Simple Model Editor supports automatic refactoring for Form Models.
When you rename, move, or delete elements that are referenced elsewhere, the tool identifies affected references and presents options for updating them.

For detailed information about refactoring capabilities, workflow, and actions, refer to the [Refactoring Support](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#refactoring_support) section in the SME Tool Documentation.

### Form Model Specific Refactoring

Form Model refactoring handles references within Form Models and references from Form Models to Document Models.
The following elements and reference types are supported:

#### Supported Operations

Form Model refactoring supports the following operations:

* Renaming or deleting screens
* Renaming or deleting controls and button panels
* Modifying navigation button targets
* Deleting master fields in referenced Document Models

#### Reference Types

The following reference types are tracked and updated during Form Model refactoring:

| Reference Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Navigation Button Targets | References from buttons to their target screens. |
| Dependent Controls | References between controls that depend on each other. |
| Initially Focused Element | References from screens to their initially focused control. |
| Initial Sorting Column | References from repeats to their default sorting column. |
| Master Field References | References from Form Model fields to Document Model fields. |
| Style References | References from controls to style definitions. |
| Sortable Columns | References from repeats to sortable column elements. |
| Custom Row Actions | References from repeats to Document Model actions. |

#### Cross-Model Refactoring

Form Models reference Document Models for their data structure.
When you modify a Document Model that a Form Model references, the refactoring system detects affected Form Model references.

For example, deleting a field in a Document Model that serves as a master field for Form Model controls triggers the refactoring dialog.
You can then choose to update the reference, select a different target, or delete the affected control.

#### Example: Deleting a Screen

Consider a Form Model with:

* A screen named `detailsScreen`
* A button with navigation target pointing to `detailsScreen`

When you delete `detailsScreen`:

1. Save the Form Model.
2. The refactoring dialog displays the affected button reference.
3. Choose one of the following actions:

   * **Commit**: Clear the navigation target (leaving an empty reference).
   * **Edit**: Select a different screen as the navigation target.
   * **Delete**: Remove the button from the Form Model.
4. The model saves with your selected changes applied.

For information about enabling or disabling Form Model refactoring, see [Enabling Within-Model Refactoring](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#enabling_refactoring) in the SME Tool Documentation.
