# Tree Modeling

This documentation is intended for a business analyst audience. Some prior knowledge of the tools is assumed.

## The Tree Model

The Tree Model is a user interface model designed to display lists of data in a hierarchical structure, based on relationships between entities. While forms are primarily used to collect data from users, business applications often require hierarchical tables to present selected aspects of datasets in an organized manner, as illustrated below.
This is the primary purpose of the Tree Model.

![TreeExample](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeExample.png)

Figure 1. Tree for Listing the Hierarchical Structure of Categories and Products

### Tree Terminology

A tree, as utilized in the Tree Engine, is a hierarchical structure consisting of ***nodes*** that are linked with each other.

[Node Types](#node-types) in trees are always defined by Document Models. The connections between nodes are established by Relationship Models, in which the respective Document Models assume specific roles.
For a tree, the two roles in a relationship must be distinguished as ***parent*** and ***child***.

Since a tree is hierarchical and requires a starting point, one of the roles in its relationships must serve as the ***root***. This creates the tree structure.

Children of the same parent are referred to as ***siblings***.

**Example**

![DiagramCategoryProduct](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/DiagramCategoryProduct.png)

Figure 2. Data Modeling Perspective for Category and Product

Consider following two Relationship Models:

* CategoryCategory: In this relationship, a category can have many sub-categories, but each category can have at most one parent category (1:n self-referencing relationship). The relationship links the Document Model `Category_DM` to itself in the roles of *Parent-Category* and *Sub-Category*.
* ProductCategory: In this relationship, a category can have many products, and a product can belong to several categories (n:n relationship). The relationship links the Document Model `Category_DM` in the role of *Category* and `ProductsAll_DM` in the role of *Product*.

In the CategoryCategory relationship, the role *Parent-Category* represents the parent, while the role *Sub-Category* represents the child.

In the ProductCategory relationship, the role *Category* represents the parent, while the role *Product* represents the child.

These two relationships yield two Node Types in the tree:

* `Category_DM` in the roles of *Parent-Category*, *Sub-Category*, and *Category*
* `ProductsAll_DM` in the role of *Product*

In this tree, the root role is *Parent-Category*. This means the roots of the tree are instances of `Category_DM` that are not linked to other instances of `ProductsAll_DM` in the *Sub-Category* role. Roots do not have parents.

If a category has several sub-categories, those sub-categories are siblings, as are products within the same category. Categories at the root level, which do not have a parent, are not considered siblings.

### Ordering of Siblings

If no relationship used in the tree allows user-defined ordering, siblings of the same parent are displayed in their default order (see [Link Order](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/relationships_for_bas/index.html#_link_order) for more details).

If ***the child role*** of a relationship used in the tree is configured to allow user-defined ordering, the order of siblings of ***the same parent*** can be changed via drag-and-drop.
Ensure that [Drag and Drop](#drag-and-drop) is enabled and the checkbox ***Allow drag & drop*** in [Node Types](#node-types) for the siblings is selected.

When a new sibling is created, it is placed at the top of the list of siblings by default, as it is the newest entry. If a user drops a child onto a parent node, the child is automatically sorted to the top of the siblings list.

Ordering of links is supported for heterogeneous relationships as well.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For first-level nodes, it is typically **not** possible to reorder them because they have no parent. However, if the tree is displayed as a sub-tree of a [hidden root node](https://geta12.com/docs/TREE_ENGINE/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html#advanced/hidden-root-node), these nodes can be reordered via drag-and-drop like other nodes. |

## Creating a New Tree Model

To add a new Tree Model, first select a Workspace.
To open a Workspace, click the ***Open Workspace*** button and browse to the directory where the new model will be saved.

Note that a Tree Model requires Document Model and Relationship Model files as references, so the Workspace should contain these files.

![OpenWorkspace](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/OpenWorkspace.png)

Figure 3. Open a Workspace

Alternatively, you may select a recent workspace.

Next, click ***Add/Tree Model***.

![AddTreeModel](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/AddTreeModel.png)

Figure 4. Add New Tree Model

A dialog will appear with the following fields:

* ***Folder:*** The location where the new model will be saved.
* ***Name:*** The name of the new model, which should match the file name.
* ***Locales:*** The list of supported locales.
* ***Roles:*** The roles that can access this model.

For additional details, refer to [Model Settings](#model-settings).

![AddTreeDialog](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/AddTreeDialog.png)

Figure 5. New Tree Dialog

After entering all required information, click the ***OK*** button to proceed to the ***Tree Model Editor***.

### Model Settings

In ***Model Settings*** tab of ***Tree Model Editor***, ***Name***, ***Locales*** and ***Roles*** are filled from the ***Add Tree Model*** form.

***Model Version*** is based on the SME version and cannot be changed.

![TreeHeaderInfo](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeHeaderInfo.png)

Figure 6. Tree header details

#### Locales

For a multilingual application, the supported locales can be defined as part of the model settings. Click the ***ADD*** button in the ***Locales*** section to add new locales. Default value "en" for English. Additional country codes can be added for multilingual support by using the locale code (for example, "en, en\_GB, en\_US, de, fr, nl…​").

![TreeLocales](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeLocales.png)

Figure 7. Locales

#### Labels and Subtitles

![LabelAndSubtitleInTreeEngine](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/LabelAndSubtitleInTreeEngine.png)

Figure 8. Label and Subtitle in Tree Engine

Label is displayed in the header at the top of the table. It is also used as hidden text which is used for accessibility.
Subtitle is the small text below label.

Label and subtitle are multilingual, so for each locale the corresponding value can be specified.

Checking ***Hide Label*** checkbox will only hide the model label at the header. The hidden text will still be available.

![LabelsAndSubtitles](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/LabelsAndSubtitles.png)

Figure 9. Multilingual Labels and Subtitles

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If there is no label or it is hidden, both ***Label*** and ***Subtitle*** will not be shown. |

#### Roles and Annotations

The roles that you can assign to your model are taken from a YAML file in the Workspace. If you have created your Workspace using the Preview App Control, this file is in the "user" folder and is called "access-rights.yaml". If no valid YAML file is visible to the SME, then the drop-down will be blank and the assignment of roles is optional.

An Annotation is a name-value pair that can be added to the model and some model elements. The application that contains the Tree Model can access those Annotations and can use them within custom implementation, for example, to show all fields that have an Annotation in boldface.

In order to apply an Annotation, fill in the inline repeat with name/value pairs.

![Annotations](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/Annotations.png)

Figure 10. Add a new Annotation

### Custom Actions

The tab ***Custom Actions*** contains sections which are used to configure:

* Buttons for the Subheader and Footer
* Position for [Multi-Selection](#multi-selection) and [Expand All PopUp](#expand-collapse-the-whole-tree).

![CustomActions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/CustomActions.png)

Figure 11. Custom Actions

#### Subheader

When clicking on button ***ADD*** of ***Minor*** or ***Major*** section, a detached repeat screen is opened to create a respective *Action Type*: ***Button***, ***Multi-Selection***, or ***Expand All PopUp***.

![TreeSubHeaderActionType](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeSubHeaderActionType.png)

Figure 12. Choose type for Subheader’s action

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is only one action of each ***Multi-Selection*** or ***Expand All PopUp*** allowed across the Subheader.  If the action type is ***Button***, the additional configurations will be shown. |

##### Event

Select or enter the event that will be linked to the button, see [Default Actions](#default-actions) section for more details.

##### Confirmation Text

Multilingual confirmation is an optional part of button, includes title and messages, this is especially useful in the case of a delete button.

Tree Engine will not show the confirmation dialog if both title and message are missing.

![ButtonConfirmation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ButtonConfirmation.png)

Figure 13. Confirmation

##### Button Styling

Configure button style by using drop-down ***Priority*** and toggle switch ***Destructive***.

![TreeButtonStyling](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeButtonStyling.png)

Figure 14. Button Styling

* ***Priority:*** sets style (***Secondary*** or ***Primary***)
* ***Destructive:*** sets color. If destructive is set, then the corresponding button will be red. This might be useful to amplify the action, for example, a red Delete button.

All buttons will appear as ***Secondary*** and ***non-destructive*** by default.

Consider consulting the [Plasma documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/PLASMA/plasma-concept-documentation/index.html#_buttons_2) and the [Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/general/buttons/button) for guidelines on button styling.

![ButtonPreview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ButtonPreview.png)

Figure 15. Button styles in Widgets showcase

###### Icon

Use Icon field to add an icon for the button. See the section [Icon](#icon) for more details.

###### Label and Description

***Label*** is the text displayed inside a button while ***Description*** is shown when a button is being hovered. Both are multilingual texts and can be configured separately.

Either a label or an icon is necessary for the button to be displayed properly.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For accessibility, the aria-label is generated based on ***Label*** and ***Description***. For example, if the given ***Label*** and ***Description*** are "***label***" and "***description***" respectively, the button’s aria-label will be "***label*** - ***description***". |

###### Hide Label

By default, ***Hide Label*** is not enabled.

When this option is set, the button will be displayed as icon only.
If ***Description*** is not defined, then ***Label*** will be shown when hovering the button.

###### Styles

***Styles*** must first be set in the ***Tree*** tab in order to be available for choosing here.
See section [Styles](#styles) for more details.

#### Footer

Footer is similar to [Subheader](#subheader), but the available action is ***Button*** only.

![TreeFooterButton](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeFooterButton.png)

Figure 16. Adding a footer button to the tree

### Tree

The tab **Tree** contains the following:

* Columns
* Node Types
* Features
* Styles

![TabTree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TabTree.png)

Figure 17. Tab Tree

#### Columns

The next step is to define columns which will appear in the tree. Set up the names, labels, etc. for the columns first, then go to each [Node Types](#node-types) and map these columns to fields in the Document Model.

Clicking on the ***ADD*** button in the columns section opens a detached repeat screen for entering details of this column. The ***Name*** of column is mandatory.

![TreeColumns](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeColumns.png)

Figure 18. Selecting Columns for the Tree

##### Pin Direction

Pin direction is used to make column to be pinned on the left/right respectively when the user scrolls the tree. By pinning a column, its width will always be a fixed value (in pixels).

SME will re-arrange the columns so that the left pinned columns are always at the beginning of the column list, and the right pinned ones are at the end.

![ColumnPinDirection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ColumnPinDirection.png)

Figure 19. Columns Order with Pin Direction

##### Fixed Width

By default, column widths are responsive, expanding to fill the remaining space based on their defined values in model.
Therefore, a column’s width may be different depending on the browser resolution.
However, if fixed width is enabled for the column, the column width will be fixed at `width` \* 150px (`width` is the value defined in model).

##### Width

The column width can be defined by setting a decimal number starting with 0.3. Steps of 0.1 can be used.
The default setting for the column width is 1.0. When using the default plasma styling, 1.0 is equivalent to 150 pixels.
Accordingly, a width of, for example, 0.5 is equivalent to 75 pixels and 2.5 is equivalent to 375 pixels.

For non-pinned columns, the value defines a minimum width.
If there is more space available, all non-pinned columns will grow proportionally according to their width ratio.

For pinned columns, the value defines a fixed width. Pinned columns will not grow if more space is available, neither shrink if less space is available.
Therefore, please define a sensible size for the pinned column, so that it will not get bigger than the table itself.
And do not overuse the pinned column since it will always be visible and consume the space of the table.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When a tree is placed in a constrained area, such as a left or right panel, responsive column sizing may cause the layout to break. To avoid this, either set sensible widths for the columns or configure the table to be wider than the surrounding area. |

For more details please consult the [Table API](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/data-display/table/api) from Widgets showcase.

##### Column Header

Column header can have ***Icon*** and ***Label (Multilingual)*** to display in 3 modes: icon only, text only or combination of icon and text.

To specify an icon, fill the icon name or choose from the icon picker in the ***Icon*** field.
To define the multilingual label, enter value to the ***Value*** fields in section ***Label***.

![TreeColumnHeader](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeColumnHeader.png)

Figure 20. Icon and Multilingual Labels

* To display icon only, define the icon and the label, then check the ***Hide Label*** checkbox. The column label will be used as icon title.
* To display text only, skip the icon, just define the label, and make sure the ***Hide Label*** checkbox is not checked.
  To display the combination of icon and text, define the icon, label, and do not check the ***Hide Label*** checkbox.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For accessibility certification, if only the icon is displayed, a label should be defined and then make hidden using the ***Hide Label*** checkbox, so that screen reader can read column name properly. |

##### Alignment

For each column, horizontal and vertical alignments can be set. By default, vertical alignments of header and content cells are Middle and Top respectively.
The horizontal alignment is ***Right*** for columns with **Number** data type and is ***Left*** otherwise.

![TreeColumnAlignment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeColumnAlignment.png)

Figure 21. Alignment for Columns

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For the multi-select column, Tree Engine may render a bullet list for the default [display mode](#display-mode), which does not look nice when combining with center or right horizontal alignment. Currently, there is no nice graphical solution neither a professional necessity. However, please be aware SME does not forbid this option. |

##### Styles

The ***Styles*** section allows adding styles for the header and content cells. Note that styles must first be defined in ***Tree*** tab in order to be available for selection here. See section [Styles](#styles) for more details.

![TreeColumnStyles](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeColumnStyles.png)

Figure 22. Column Styles

##### Hierarchical Column

After adding columns, next step is to define ***Hierarchical Column***. The selected column should be a common field between models, i.e. the same field exists for multiple models in the relationship, so data can be shown in this column for rows that are different types. In the example below, the field ***Name*** exists in both the team and the person model so this column can display data for both people and teams.

![TreeHierarchicalColumn](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeHierarchicalColumn.png)

Figure 23. Hierarchical Column

#### Node Types

Node types describe the type of entity that can be displayed in current tree. For example if someone has a tree that displays teams and people in those teams, then there are two types of node, ***Team*** and ***Person***.

Clicking on the ***ADD*** button in the ***Node Types*** section opens a detached repeat screen for entering the details for each node. First step is adding the node for ***Team***. Select the ***DomainTeam*** from the drop-down of available Document Models.

Check the ***Allow drag & drop*** box to allow drag and drop for this node type.

![TreeNodes](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeNodes.png)

Figure 24. Node Types

##### Icon

Fill the name in **Icon** field and choose an icon accordingly.

![SpecifyNodeIcons](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/SpecifyNodeIcons.png)

Figure 25. Specify node type icons

As a result, the specified icon will be displayed in the cells of the hierarchical column.

![NodeIcons](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/NodeIcons.png)

Figure 26. Node type icons

For more details, please see the section [Icon](#icon).

##### Column Mapping

![TreeNodesColumnMapping](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeNodesColumnMapping.png)

Figure 27. Mapping columns to data fields when adding node types

Next step is mapping defined columns to the fields in ***DomainTeam*** Document Model. There are drop-downs that are pre-filled with all available columns and all available fields in the selected Document Model.

If the selected element is of type attachment or multi-select, a drop-down will display to configure Display Mode. The attachment can be displayed as:

* ***Preview***: display supported images. For other file types, an icon will be shown instead.
* ***Icon with file name***: display file icon and file name.
* ***Icon***: display file icon with file name shown as title.
* ***File name***: display file name only.

The multi-select can be displayed as:

* ***Default:*** display as a bullet list when [row height](#row-height-and-action-column-width) is not set. Otherwise, it will be a comma-separated list.
* ***Comma Separated:*** always display as a comma-separated list.

![ColumnDisplayMode](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ColumnDisplayMode.png)

Figure 28. Display Mode

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * For data type multi-select, the child field may be an enumeration or a string (for external enumeration).   Since Tree Engine has not supported external enumeration yet, the multi-select with string field has not been supported either. * Fields whose data is shown in the Column must be indexed. Using Fields with the Annotation "indexed" = "false" in Element References will lead to an error in the Simple Model Editor. |

##### Child Relationship Configurations

Click ***ADD*** in this section to add a new relationship configuration for this node type. First, select the relationship from the pre-filled drop-down. This drop-down will show all relationships in the current Workspace.

![TreeRelationshipConfig](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeRelationshipConfig.png)

Figure 29. Selecting a relationship

All available roles for the selected relationship are then displayed in the ***Parent role*** drop-down. Select the role which is the parent in the hierarchy.

If there are link fields associated with the selected relationship, it is possible to map the link Document Model’s fields to the columns in the tree by using the ***Column Mapping*** section on the ***Child Relationship Configurations*** page. Note that this column mapping will be displayed in **child nodes**.

###### Warning "Missing node type for child role of relationship"

In case of heterogeneity, Data Services returns all links based on the specific relationship model, and Tree Engine will read this response to show them.
A runtime error will be thrown when Tree Engine finds a document not configured as a node type in the tree.

![TeamPersonWithHeterogeneity](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TeamPersonWithHeterogeneity.png)

Figure 30. Relationship TeamPerson

For example, in the relationship TeamPerson (image above), Person\_DM is an abstract document model with two subtypes: PersonEmployee\_DM and PersonFreelancer\_DM.
If only PersonEmployee\_DM is added as a node type in the tree model, a runtime error will be thrown when Tree Engine finds a document belonging to PersonFreelancer\_DM.
To solve it, the supertype Person\_DM should be added, or both subtypes PersonEmployee\_DM and PersonFreelancer\_DM should be added.

If any child node is missing in the child relationship configuration, a warning stating "Missing node type for child role of relationship" will appear.
When the current project ensures that the missing document will never appear in Tree Engine, this warning can be safely ignored.

##### Actions

In the ***Actions*** section, click button ***ADD*** to add a row action button, which will appear in the tree rows for each node type.

Action button can have type ***event*** or ***insert***.

The ***event*** action is similar to buttons in [Custom Actions](#custom-actions).
Note that when ***Hide Label*** is enabled, the defined ***Label*** (which is hidden) will be used as the list item text when users right-click on the row.
If ***Label*** is empty, the Tree Engine will use Description as the list item text.

The ***insert*** action is quite similar to an ***event*** action, with a few differences:

* Insert action does not have confirmation text.
* It requires a position to specify where the new node will be inserted. Position can be *as child*, *above* or *below*.
* This action can have a specified Document Model based on the selected position.
  In this case, the row action button can reuse the Document Model name as its label or title, by using the checkbox ***Use Label From Document Model*** or ***Use Description From Document Model***.
  It can also reuse the node type icon as its icon by checking the checkbox ***Use Global Icon***.

![RowActionTypeInsert](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/RowActionTypeInsert.png)

Figure 31. Row action with type insert

When clicking the row action button, the Tree Engine will open a new form based on the Document Model.

If the insert action does not specify any Document Model, the Tree Engine will display a dialog with the list of possible Document Models based on the configured position.

For more details about supported types and supported events, please refer to [Default Actions](#default-actions) section.

##### Context Menu

Click the ***ADD*** button will open a detached repeat screen for entering the details for each group of context menu.

For the context menu group, multilingual labels can be set. Moreover, the ***Actions*** section allows adding actions for the group, similar to adding row actions, but without ***Priority***, ***Destructive*** and ***Hide Label***.

![ContextMenu](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ContextMenu.png)

Figure 32. Context menu

A group can have type ***add***, which contains only ***insert*** actions.

![ContextMenuGroupAdd](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ContextMenuGroupAdd.png)

Figure 33. Group add

##### Default Row Action

This section defines what happens when users click a row. The default action is "View/Edit". To change the default action, specify a "Custom Row Action". Enter a custom event that can be handled in the application embedding this model. The ***Event*** then can be used in the custom code that handles this event.

![DefaultRowAction](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/DefaultRowAction.png)

Figure 34. Default Row Action

##### Title For Interactive Rows

When hovering over an interactive row, a title will appear to let the users know some information, like what happens when clicking the row.
This multilingual title is also used for accessibility.

![TitleForInteractiveRows](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TitleForInteractiveRows.png)

Figure 35. Title For Interactive Rows

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If the row is not interactive, for example, if it is disabled or busy, or the Tree Engine is disabled, its title will be empty. |

##### Styles

This section defines the styles for the node type, each style can be selected from the pre-defined [Styles](#styles).

##### Inherit From Supertype

This section only appears for a node that is a subtype node, which can inherit some configurations of the [supertype](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/heterogeneity/index.html#_supertype_entity) one. Refer to the [Modeling Heterogeneous Data documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/heterogeneity/index.html#_supertype_entity) for guidance on configuring a heterogeneous tree.

Configurations that can be inherited are:

* Icon
* Columns Mapping
* Child Relationship Configurations
* Actions
* Context Menu
* Default Row Action
* Styles

If a configuration is inherited, the respective section will be hidden.

In the image below, ***DomainAttachmentGroup*** is a *subtype* of **DomainGroup**, so it can inherit the configurations for *Columns Mapping* and *Child Relationship Configurations* from the node type **DomainGroup**.
Sections *Columns Mapping* and *Child Relationship Configurations* are also hidden.

![TreeSubTypeNode](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeSubTypeNode.png)

Figure 36. Node type for DomainAttachmentGroup

![TreeSuperTypeNode](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeSuperTypeNode.png)

Figure 37. Node type for DomainGroup

##### Root Configuration

After adding node types, next step is telling Tree Engine which relationship will be used for determining the root nodes of the tree.

![TreeRootConfiguration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeRootConfiguration.png)

Figure 38. Root configuration

This drop-down only displays the Relationship Models which are defined in [Child Relationship Configurations](#child-relationship-configuration). In this example, the root node is a team and a team can have sub teams, so ***TeamTeam*** relationship in ***DomainTeam*** node type should be selected.

#### Features

![TreeFeatures](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeFeatures.png)

Figure 39. Features

Section ***Features*** in the tab ***Tree*** contains the following:

##### Multi-Selection

###### Enable Multi-Selection

This checkbox will enable the ***Multi-Selection*** feature and show more available settings.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When ***Multi-Selection*** is enabled, its position can be configured by a ***Multi-Selection*** action type in the [Subheader](#subheader). |

![EnableMultiSelection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/EnableMultiSelection.png)

Figure 40. Enable Multi-Selection

###### Display Multi-Selection

This drop-down defines the display of the Multi-Selection panel, with three options:

* ***Collapsible (Collapsed):*** the panel is collapsible and collapsed initially. This is the default value.
* ***Collapsible (Expanded):*** the panel is collapsible and expanded initially.
* ***Non-Collapsible:*** the panel is no longer collapsible. It also makes Multi-Selection checkboxes always visible.

![DisplayMultiSelection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/DisplayMultiSelection.png)

Figure 41. Display Multi-Selection

###### Display Counter

This drop-down defines the display of the selected document counter, with two options:

* ***Simple:*** the Multi-Selection panel will contain the counter when it is expanded. This is the default value.
* ***None:*** the counter is always hidden.

![DisplayCounter](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/DisplayCounter.png)

Figure 42. Display Counter

###### Interactive Area

This drop-down defines the interactive area of the Multi-Selection in the UI, with two options:

* **Checkbox and Row:** The checkbox and the entire row are clickable to select or deselect the document.
* **Checkbox only:** Only the checkbox is clickable to select or deselect the document.

![InteractiveAreaMultiselection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/InteractiveAreaMultiselection.png)

Figure 43. Interactive Area

###### Select Parent Node When All Child Nodes Are Selected

When all child nodes are checked, by default the parent node is marked as intermediate.
If this option is enabled, the parent node will be also marked as checked.

###### Actions for Multi-Selection

The ***Actions for Multi-Selection*** section defines the actions that could be applied for selected documents.
These actions are shown like [Subheader](#subheader) or [Footer](#footer-elements) buttons but contained in the Multi-Selection panel.

Clicking on the ***ADD*** button will open a detached repeat screen to configure the action’s details.

![ActionMultiSelection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ActionMultiSelection.png)

Figure 44. Action for Multi-Selection

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Multi-Selection action configuration is similar to the [Subheader](#subheader) or [Footer](#footer-elements) button’s. Moreover, the engine can show a confirmation dialog before triggering the action, which is configurable in the detached screen. |

###### Confirmation Text

Closing Multi-Selection panel will clear selected rows. To warn the user about that, use the ***Display confirmation before clearing selected rows*** checkbox.
Note that this checkbox is checked by default.

The dialog will use the below multilingual titles and messages. If both are empty fields, the default engine value will be used.

![ConfirmationTextMultiSelection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/ConfirmationTextMultiSelection.png)

##### Drag and Drop

![TreeDragAndDrop](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeDragAndDrop.png)

Figure 46. Drag and Drop

By default, the ***Drag And Drop*** feature is enabled together with ***Expand on hover***.
The checkbox ***Expand on hover*** indicates Tree Engine to automatically expand a node when being hovered by a dragged node.

![TreeExpandOnHover](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeExpandOnHover.gif)

Figure 47. Expand on Hover

All node types are allowed to drag by default. To make a node type not possible to drag, select its row to see detail and uncheck the checkbox ***Allow Drag***.

![TreeNodeAllowDrag](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeNodeAllowDrag.png)

Figure 48. Allow Drag in Node Types

Uncheck the checkbox ***Enable Drag And Drop*** will disable this feature. Then it is not possible to configure ***Expand on hover*** and ***Allow Drag*** anymore.

There are 3 areas to drop a node:

* Top: make the dragged node above the target node
* The whole row: there are 2 cases based on their relationship

  + The dragged node will be a child of the target node
  + The dragged node will be the below sibling of the target node
* Bottom: make the dragged node below the target node

##### Expansion Strategy

There are two strategies to expand a tree: ***Level by level*** and ***Tree***.

* Level by level: the Tree Engine load only one level per request to Data Services. This is the current behavior and also the default mode. It is possible to define the initial expansion state of the Tree Engine by using the ***Initial Expansion*** configuration.
* Tree: this strategy is still ***experimental***. Since the Data Services Query API allows loading multiple levels in a query, the Tree Engine will load multiple levels based on the predefined relationships and its max depths.

###### Initial Expansion

This configuration defines the initial expansion state of the Tree Engine, ***when Expansion Strategy is set to "Level by level"***.

The checkbox ***Enable Initial Expansion*** is not checked by default, then the Tree Engines will load the root level only. Check this checkbox to enable this feature.

![TreeInitialExpansion](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeInitialExpansion.png)

Figure 49. Initial Expansion

* ***Type:*** 2 available types: *Expand by a pre-defined level* and *Expand all possible nodes*
* ***Number Of Levels:*** define the number of levels will be expanded for type *Expand by a pre-defined level*
* ***Node Types To Apply:*** the list of node types to expand, leave it empty to expand all possible nodes.

###### Tree Strategy Configuration

When the ***Expansion Strategy*** is set to ***Tree***, the Tree Engine will load multiple levels based on the predefined relationships and its max depths.

![TreeStrategyConfiguration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeStrategyConfiguration.png)

Figure 50. Tree Strategy Configuration

All relationships in the tree should be listed here. If the relationship is recursive, Max Depth may be bigger than 1. If not, Max Depth should be 1.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Max Depth must not exceed `query.maxQueryDepth` as defined in the [Data Services' Query Configuration](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#query-configuration); otherwise, an error will occur. To resolve this, either reduce the configured Max Depth or increase the `query.maxQueryDepth` limit in the Data Services configuration. * For a non-recursive relationship, Max Depth is always treated as 1. Setting it greater than 1 will only load a single level. |

##### Expand/Collapse The Whole Tree

Check the checkbox **Enable Expand/Collapse The Whole Tree** to enable this feature. A popup menu will appear in the subheader, with have two buttons: **Expand All** and **Collapse All**.

* ***Expand All***: expand all tree nodes, no matter a node is expanded/collapsed or has not been loaded yet.
* ***Collapse All***: collapse all tree nodes.

![TreeExpandCollapseWholeTree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeExpandCollapseWholeTree.png)

Figure 51. Expand/Collapse Tree

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * The position of the popup menu can be configured by an ***Expand All PopUp*** action type in the [Subheader](#subheader). * If the number of links from a node in a relationship exceeds the `query.maxLinksSize` of [Data Services' Query Configuration](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#query-configuration), an error will be thrown. Increase the Data Services configuration to resolve it. |

##### Pagination

***This configuration is only available when Expansion Strategy is set to "Level by level".***

Pagination allows users to limit the number of nodes to be loaded on certain subtrees which may have a large number of relationship links.
This would result in better performance in the long term.

![TreePagination](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreePagination.png)

Figure 52. Pagination in Tree Engine

Click on the ***Load more*** button to keep exploring the subtree. Expand the whole subtree by clicking on the ***Load all*** button.

![EnablePagination](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/EnablePagination.png)

Figure 53. Enable Pagination

To enable this feature for the Tree Engine, check the ***Enable Pagination*** checkbox, then adjust the ***Page Size*** number.
It is the number of child nodes should be loaded when clicking on the ***Load more*** button.
By default, ***Page Size*** is prefilled as 10.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Some features are not affected by pagination:  * Root nodes: Pagination is used to load child nodes only and does not affect root nodes.   In case [root node is hidden](https://geta12.com/docs/TREE_ENGINE/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html#advanced/hidden-root-node), the 1st level nodes are not root nodes, so all node levels in the tree can be paginated. * Multi-selection on a parent node: Trigger a multi-select event on a parent node always trigger the ***Load all*** recursive event of that subtree because of the nature of the bulk operation.   However, selecting a non-parent node will not trigger this behavior. * Scroll to node: Scroll to node should always ignore the pagination because the current design of the node path does not tell the index of the target node.   Therefore, it makes more sense to always load all children on the path and then do the scrolling. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Page Size must not exceed the `query.pageRequest.pageSizeLimit` from [Data Services' Query Configuration](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#query-configuration); otherwise, an error will be returned from the Data Services.  + Since Data Services support pagination but not offset/limit, the Tree Engine calculates the page size in certain cases. The Page Size sent to Data Services may exceed the configured Page Size but will not be greater than twice the configured Page Size.   + When clicking the ***Load all*** button, the Tree Engine will request the page number as 0 and the page size as the total number of links (fullSize).   + To resolve the exceed error, adjust the Data Services' `query.pageRequest.pageSizeLimit` to ensure it is greater than the maximum number of links in a relationship. This prevents errors when clicking the ***Load all*** button. Additionally, ensure the configured Page Size is smaller than this limit. * The same issue occurs if the number of links from a node in a relationship exceeds the `query.maxLinksSize` or if the page number is larger than the `query.pageRequest.pageNumberLimit` in the [Data Services' Query Configuration](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#query-configuration). Increase the Data Services configuration to resolve it. |

##### Virtual Scrolling

To use this feature, check the checkbox ***Enable Virtual Scrolling***. Note that this option requires [***Row Height*** and ***Action Column Width***](#row-height-and-action-column-width).

![VirtualScrolling](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/VirtualScrolling.png)

Figure 54. Virtual Scrolling

##### Row Height and Action Column Width

* ***Row Height***: Specify a fixed height for the rows. It should be larger than a button height (32px in the default theme).

When content is too long, an ellipsis (…​) will be displayed to indicate that the content was cut. For multi-select, a comma will be used to separated list instead of Bullet List.
When hover over the cell, a tooltip will be shown to display fully the content.

![EllipsisWithFixedRowHeight](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/EllipsisWithFixedRowHeight.png)

Figure 55. Ellipsis for Fixed Row Height

* ***Action Column Width***: The max width of the action column when all buttons are displayed.

![RowHeightAndActionColumnWidth](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/RowHeightAndActionColumnWidth.png)

Figure 56. Row Height and Action Column Width

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If the ***Action Column Width*** is not large enough to display all buttons, they will be cut off.  * For ***Virtual Scrolling***, it is necessary to explicitly set the ***Action Column Width*** to ensure all buttons are visible. * When ***Virtual Scrolling*** is not enabled, specifying the ***Action Column Width*** is not required. If it is not set, the action column will automatically adjust its width to fit all buttons. |

##### Columns Resize

Check the checkbox ***Enable Columns Resize*** to make columns resizable. Note that it will disable the responsive feature of columns, this means all columns will have fixed width.

Action column is not resizable, since its width always depends on its children.

For more details, please refer to the part Table → Resizable Columns of the Widgets showcase.

![TreeColumnsResize](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeColumnsResize.png)

Figure 57. Columns Resize

##### Virtual Root

Enable this feature will show a Virtual Root node in the tree. It will display as the first row in the tree, with row action buttons and context menu.

![VirtualRootInTreeEngine](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/VirtualRootInTreeEngine.png)

Figure 58. Virtual Root With Actions

The Virtual Root needs multilingual label to display in the **Hierarchical Column** of the tree. The [Actions](#node-type-actions) and [Context Menu](#node-type-context-menu) can be configured like a node, but the supported events are different, see [Default Actions](#default-actions) section for more details.

![VirtualRootConfiguration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/VirtualRootConfiguration.png)

Figure 59. Virtual Root Configuration

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When the tree has no node, the Virtual Root will not appear. To add the first node to the tree, the context menu of Virtual Root configuration should have a [group add](#node-type-context-menu-group-add). |

![VirtualRootButtonAdd](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/VirtualRootButtonAdd.png)

Figure 60. Add Button

Then an Add button will display as the image above. Clicking to the button Add, its actions will be shown as a popup menu:

![VirtualRootClickButtonAdd](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/VirtualRootClickButtonAdd.png)

Figure 61. Pop-up Menu of Add Button

#### Styles

The ***Styles*** section is collapsed by default.
It contains a repeat to add a list of logical style names defined in this model, which can be used to apply custom CSS.
For these styles, there are many [Helper Classes](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/basics/helper-classes) listed in the Widgets Showcase.
First, list all styles of the tree by adding an entry for each one.

![TreeStyles](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeStyles.png)

Figure 62. Styles

Those styles are then available for applying to the individual controls on the Tree Model.

![TreeStylesUse](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/TreeStylesUse.png)

Figure 63. Apply styles

### Common Properties

#### Icon

In Tree Model, elements such as buttons, node actions or node types can have icons.
The icons in Tree Engine are from Widgets which support Material Design icons and custom icons.
To specify an icon, fill the icon name to the icon picker, then select an icon accordingly.

![IconPicker](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/assets/IconPicker.png)

Figure 64. Icon Picker

For more details about Material Icon, please refer to [The material icon page](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons). The link to this page is also available below every icon name field in SME for quick access.

Widgets also come with some custom icons, go to [Widget custom icons](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/general/icon#custom-icons) to search for custom icons.

For further details about **Icon**, please refer to this page [Widgets Icon](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/general/icon).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Material Icons website can be used for easier searching. However, if there is an icon which is new and not found in our picker, please do not use it. |

#### Default Actions

There are some CRUD and expand/collapse actions which are shipped with Tree Engine by default. Each type of action can be used differently depend on its context.

Table 1. Predefined actions

## Adding a Tree to an Application

Integrating a Tree Model into an application is primarily intended for developers, as it requires some familiarity with code. For further information, refer to the [Tree Engine Documentation for Developers](https://geta12.com/docs/TREE_ENGINE/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html).

The [Modeling Environment Installer](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/installing_a12/index.html) includes the integrated Tree Engine.
To proceed with configuring an Application Model, consult the section [Application Model](https://geta12.com/docs/TREE_ENGINE/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html#application-model) in the Tree Engine documentation for instructions on integrating a Tree Model into the [Preview Application](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/preview_app/index.html).

# Refactoring

The Simple Model Editor supports automatic refactoring for Tree Models.
When you rename, move, or delete elements that are referenced elsewhere, the tool identifies affected references and presents options for updating them.

For detailed information about refactoring capabilities, workflow, and actions, refer to the [Refactoring Support](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#refactoring_support) section in the SME Tool Documentation.

## Tree Model Specific Refactoring

Tree Model refactoring handles references within Tree Models when nodes, columns, or relationships are modified.
The following elements and reference types are supported:

### Supported Operations

Tree Model refactoring supports the following operations:

* Deleting columns
* Deleting node types
* Deleting child relationship configurations
* Disabling feature toggles such as multi-selection or expand-all

### Reference Types

The following reference types are tracked and updated during Tree Model refactoring:

| Reference Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Hierarchical Column Reference | Reference to the column used for hierarchical display. |
| Column Mappings | References from nodes to their column configurations. |
| Root Configuration | Reference to the root child relationship configuration. |
| Node Actions | References in insert actions and context menu actions. |
| Initial Expansion | References to nodes used in initial expansion strategy. |
| Style References | References from nodes and columns to style definitions. Style refactoring is applied silently without user confirmation. |
| Virtual Root Actions | References in virtual root insert and context menu actions. |
| Child Relationship References | References between nodes and their child relationship configurations. |

### Example: Deleting a Column

Consider a Tree Model with:

* A column named `nameColumn` configured as the hierarchical column
* Multiple nodes with column mappings referencing `nameColumn`

When you delete `nameColumn`:

1. Save the Tree Model.
2. The refactoring dialog displays the affected references:

   * Hierarchical column reference
   * Column mappings in each node type
3. Choose one of the following actions:

   * **Commit**: Clear the references (requires selecting a new hierarchical column).
   * **Edit**: Select a different column for each reference.
4. The model saves with your selected changes applied.

### Example: Deleting a Node Type

When you delete a node type that is referenced elsewhere:

1. The refactoring system detects all references to the node.
2. The refactoring dialog displays affected elements:

   * Root configuration (if the node was the root)
   * Insert actions in other nodes
   * Initial expansion configuration
   * Child relationship configurations
3. You can choose to update, redirect, or remove each reference.

### Silent Style Refactoring

Style references in Tree Models are refactored silently without user confirmation.
When you delete a style, all references to that style in nodes and columns are automatically cleared.

For information about enabling or disabling Tree Model refactoring, see [Enabling Within-Model Refactoring](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html#enabling_refactoring) in the SME Tool Documentation.
