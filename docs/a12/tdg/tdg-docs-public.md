## Introduction

The Test Data Generator (TDG) generates **technical** test data based on A12 Kernel **Document Models**.
Moreover, it can be used for checking for **Rule Contradictions** in Document Models.

For testing the concrete customer application test data are needed.
These test data have to be valid according to the rules defined by the A12 Validation Language.
Manually creating test data can be very tedious and time-consuming, especially if every field of the Document Model should be tested.
This task becomes increasingly infeasible to perform by hand if the Document Model includes complex relations and dependencies between fields.

TDG automatically creates such test data.
The test data generation only requires the Document Model and no further functional knowledge.
The created test data represent no typical user data, but provide other qualities, such as testing extreme values, using all allowed characters or generating other interesting states, taken from the rules in the Document Model.

Your options to benefit from the Test Data Generator are:

* Use TDG as a Command Line Tool.
* Include TDG as a Java-Library in other Java projects.
* Include TDG String generator as a Java-Library in other Java projects.

### Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to use the TDG Command Line Tool:

1. Create a Document Model.
2. [Download the Test Data Generator Command Line Tool.](#txt:quickref:commandline-download)
3. [Run the Test Data Generator.](#txt:quickref:commandline-run)

### Technical Requirements

TDG is developed and tested for:

* Windows 10 (64 bit)
* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (64 bit)
* MacOS 14.5 (Sonoma)

Additionally, an installed Java JRE is required (minimal Java 21).

## Test Data Generator Usage

There are three ways to use the Test Data Generator:

* [SME](#txt:quickref:sme): A rule contradictions check is directly included in the SME.
* [Command Line Tool](#txt:quickref:commandline): A Command Line Tool which can run the rule contradictions check or create test data locally.
* [Java-Library](#txt:quickref:tdg-library): You can include TDG as a Java library into your own Java application.

### In the SME

The check for rule contradictions is directly available in the SME.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Document Model has to be without errors, to run the Rule Contradictions Check. |

* To run the rule contradictions check, click on "Rule Contradictions" on the left side of the Document Model Editor:

![03 01 01](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/03_01_01.png)

* Then click on "GENERATE" on the bottom right of the Document Model Editor:

![03 01 02](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/03_01_02.png)

* You’ll then have to insert a `TODAY`-value.
  By default, the `TODAY`-value is pre-set as the current date.
  Click "CONTINUE" to start the check:

![03 01 03](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/03_01_03.png)

This is the date which is used if `Today` is used in a rule condition.
Further information on `Today` can be found [here](#txt:quickref:today-handling).
In the SME, only one `TODAY`-value is used.

Sometimes, a reported rule contradiction can be solved by setting a different `TODAY`-value that is valid.

In chapter [Report About Rule Contradictions](#txt:quickref:ruleContradictions), the report is explained in detail.

### As a Command Line Tool

#### Download and Start

##### Download

Download the TDG Command Line Tool `tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar`:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If you are within the mgm network | [`tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar`](https://artifacts.mgm-tp.com/artifactory/a12-2025-06-enterprise-maven/com/mgmtp/a12/tdg/tdg-cl/7.8.1/tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar)  (mgm internal only) |
| If you are outside the mgm network | [`tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar`](https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-2025-06-enterprise-maven/com/mgmtp/a12/tdg/tdg-cl/7.8.1/tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar)  (mgm external only) |

It is an executable JAR file build as a Spring Boot Application, which contains all dependencies (including the SMT-Solver needed).

In case the repository cannot be accessed, please contact Professional Services in order to retrieve a copy.

##### How to Run It

The `tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar` is an executable jar, so you can run it from the Command Line.
The relative path to the Document Model file is the only required argument:

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar DocumentModel.json
```

Alternatively, you can provide a path to a directory instead of a single file.
In that case, all json-files in the directory are interpreted as Document Model files.
The test data production will run for each of these files.

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar <directory name>
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The command line tool requires a console that supports **UTF-8** encoding. If the console does not support UTF-8, the output may contain garbled characters.  On **Windows 11**, one way to enable UTF-8 support is:  *Settings > Time & Language > Language & region > Administrative language settings > Change system locale…​* > Check the box **"Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support"** and restart the system. |

#### Options

This section shows the available configuration options for the TDG Command Line Tool.
You can also run

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar --help
```

to gain further information about the available options.

For example, in order to run the Command Line Tool with *Pretty Values* and with a maximum of two cores, run:

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar --cores=2 -vP DocumentModel.json
```

In case you want to use a custom YICES2 solver executable stored at `C:\tdg\mySolver\yices2.exe`, run:

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar --cores=2 -vP -sp=C:\tdg\mySolver\yices2.exe -sn=YICES2 DocumentModel.json
```

##### The Basic Options

| Option | Explanation | Default |

| `-sn, --solver-name=<solverName>` | Name of custom Solver (must be either Z3, YICES2 or CVC5), must be used together with corresponding `-sp` option |  |
| `-t, --today=<fixToday>` | [Set a fix `TODAY`](#txt:quickref:today-handling) (yyyy-MM-dd).  - `TODAY` will **not** be a variable.  - The given today-value will be the only *today-value* used. | - `TODAY` is a variable  - 14 Today-values, starting from `now` until `now + 366 days`. |
| `-td, --duration=<duration>` | [Changes the `<duration>`](#txt:quickref:today-handling), i.e. the time in days, the test data has to be valid. In the result, there will be up to 14 `today-values`, starting with `now` until `now + duration days`.  **Not** allowed in combination with `--today` (setting a fixed `TODAY`). | 366 |
| `-tn, --noToday` | [Produces the test data, without the need of setting *today*.](#txt:quickref:today-handling)  Today will **not** be a variable.  **Not** allowed in combination with `--today` (setting a fixed `TODAY`). |  |

#### Output of the Command Line Tool (Example Execution)

* If we want to execute the Command Line Tool (JAR file) on a specific Document Model, we can have a working directory that includes both files:

```
└──myWorkingDirectory
	├──tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar
	└──DomainImpfcharge.json
```

* We can then execute the following command in the preferred shell:

```
java -jar tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar DomainImpfcharge.json -tn
```

* Once the above command finishes its execution, the working directory should look similar to:

```
└──myWorkingDirectory
	├──tdg-cl-7.8.1.jar
	├──DomainImpfcharge.json
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>.log
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>.xlsx
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_ALL_FIELDS_<number>.json
	├──...
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_HIGH_TEST_COVERAGE_<number>.json
	├──...
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_MAXIMAL_DATASET_<number>.json
	├──...
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_MINIMAL_DATASET_<number>.json
	├──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_unfillable_entities.html
	└──DomainImpfcharge_<date-of-execution>_unfillable_entities.json
```

* Where `<date-of-execution>` is set to the current date-time on which the data production command was initiated and `<number>` identifies different datasets for the same data goal.
* In detail, the files represent:

| File | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>.log | Log-File |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>.xlsx | Excel-File containing all datasets and statistical information (only use for manual inspection of test data or statistics, not standardized, **do not use as input for further data processing**). For details, see [Excel File](#txt:quickref:excel) |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_HIGH\_TEST\_COVERAGE\_<number>.json | Datasets for data goal "High Test Coverage" (H) - number of datasets strongly depends on the Document Model |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_ALL\_FIELDS\_<number>.json | Datasets for data goal "All Fields" (L) |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_MAXIMAL\_DATASET\_<number>.json | Datasets for data goal "Maximal Data Set" (X) - number of datasets mainly depends on settings.  Per default, dataset number **1** refers to strategy `PRIO_NO_WARNINGS_NO_HEUTE_BEFORE_FILL` (avoiding warnings by not filling entities), and dataset number **2** refers to strategy `PRIO_FILL_BEFORE_NO_WARNINGS_NO_HEUTE` (accepting warning, if entity can be filled) |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_MINIMAL\_DATASET\_<number>.json | Datasets for data goal "Minimal DataSets" (I) - number of datasets mainly depends on settings, per default only one dataset is produced. |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_not\_fillable.html | Report about Rule Contradictions (as HTML file which can be inspected in the browser). A report is only created, if there are not-fillable entities. |
| DomainImpfcharge\_<date-of-execution>\_not\_fillable.json | Same report, but as processable JSON file (A12 Document) |

Generally, all generated JSON files represent valid A12 Documents corresponding to the respective Document Model (in this case "DomainImpfcharge.json").
Therefore, they are processable by the Kernel API.
Only the "<…​>\_not\_fillable.json" file corresponds to a different Document Model (not publicly available).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Because of `-tn`, `TODAY` will not be a variable. Therefore, all the created testdata will have to be valid for at least one year. For the Document Model "DomainImpfcharge.json" (which is part of the installer samples), setting this option will lead to three unfillable fields. Therefore, a [Report about Rule Contradictions](#txt:quickref:ruleContradictions) will be created. |

#### Explanation of the Generated Excel File

The TDG Command Line Tool creates an Excel File, which contains all the created datasets.
The data is exactly the same as in the created JSON Documents.
The Excel File also contains sheets with related statistical information.

![02 02 01](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/02_02_01.png)

Each Excel File has two sheets that represent the same generated datasets.
In both of them, the groups and fields appear in the same order as they are declared in the Document Model.

The only difference between both sheets is that the one named "Contexts" orders the group fields by repetition while the "FullName" sheet orders them by their full name, with all the repetitions of each field being together.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 02 02 02 | 02 02 03 |

##### Explanation of Row Headers

Column A - Indicates the type of the field:

| Initials | Type of the Field |
| --- | --- |
| B | Boolean Field (YesNo) |
| C | Confirm Field (Yes) |
| D | Date Field |
| E | Enumeration Field |
| N | Number Field |
| NL | Number Field (involved in non-linearity) |
| R | DateRange Field |
| S | String Field |
| U | Custom Field (for example IBAN, BIC, or Steuernummer) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For repeatable groups, column A shows the maximum possible value of repetitions. |

Column B - Indicates if the value of a field (not the filling of the field!!) is used in any validation/calculation rule:

| Char(s) | Usage of the field value |
| --- | --- |
| F | Free Field - Its value is not used in any rule (For more information check the [Bound Fields and Free Fields](#txt:quickref:boundFreeFields) section) |
| B | Bound Field - Its value is used in at least one rule ([Bound Fields and Free Fields](#txt:quickref:boundFreeFields)) |
| C | Calculated Field (Therefore, also a Bound Field) |
| S+[Number] | Bound field of string/enumeration/custom type. These fields are clustered. [Number] indicates the index of the cluster. |

Column D - Full names of the groups/fields (fields in blue font color are index fields):

##### Explanation of Column Headers

| Column-Headers | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Record-Number | Record-Number |
| Today | Today-Value which has to be set to make this dataset valid. Only might be filled if Today is a variable. (For details see [Today-Handling](#txt:quickref:today-handling)) |
| Warnings | Number of warnings which will arise if this dataset is validated. |

#### Restrictions

The Command Line Tool does not support custom [plugin](#txt:quickref:plugins) implementations.
*However, the A12 default custom field types are already included*.
If your Document Model includes custom plugins, such as custom field types or custom conditions, consider integrating TDG as a library.
The TDG library provides the option to pass own custom field type and custom condition implementations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If your Document Model includes custom field types or custom conditions which are not part of the default A12 Tool Set, the CLI mocks those plugins to dummy implementations. Test data generation may still be possible, however custom field types and custom conditions may not reflect the desired business logic. |

Not all possible constellations are covered by TDG up to now.
Especially, constellations with string type fields which are combined with string concatenation and regular expressions may result in an error.
A `TdgMappingNotImplementedException` will be thrown in such cases.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If TDG throws a `TdgMappingNotImplementedException`, please don’t hesitate to contact the TDG team. If necessary and reasonable, we will implement that case and release a patch. |

### As a Library

Within the mgm-network, use the following dependency to include TDG as a library:

* As Maven dependency:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-lib</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> </dependency> ``` |
```

* As Gradle dependency:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` compile(group: 'com.mgmtp.a12.tdg', name: 'tdg-lib', version: '7.8.1') ``` |
```

The package includes the `TestDataGenerator` as the entry point.
In this example, we focus on both static methods `TestDataGenerator.checkModel(…​)` and `TestDataGenerator.createTestData(…​)`.
The other offered methods of this class reflect a more general abstraction of the previous two, in order to provide more efficient data production for more than one data goal.
However, they do not provide any extra functionality.
TDG can be used in two distinctive ways:

* Search for rule contradictions in a `IDocumentModel` (see [here](#txt:quickref:ruleContradictions) for detailed information).
* To create (valid) test data in the form of an `IDocumentV2` for a given `IDocumentModel`.

In correspondence, `TestDataGenerator.checkModel(…​)` is used to perform a check, which does **not** create test data, but provides a detailed report about potential inconsistencies in the Document Model. `TestDataGenerator.createTestData(…​)` is used to create actual datasets which are valid for the given model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is only possible to create test data for documents of type `IDocumentModel` (model type: `documents`), since those provide the description of how valid data is structured. TDG does not handle other model types such as `Form Model`, `Overview Model` or other A12 model types. |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Usage of the example classes that exemplify how to check the model for potential inconsistencies and how to create test data can be done by including a dependency to the `tdg-examples` module:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-examples</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> </dependency> ``` | ``` |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | You may also use the `tdg-bom` in your dependency management in order to align Kernel and Jackson versions with the desired TDG version. Be aware that the BOM also manages other third party library versions that may collide with versions required in your project. However, the aforementioned `tdg-lib` package is a sufficient include with minimal dependency management required for TDG.  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-bom</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> 	<type>pom</type> 	<scope>import</scope> </dependency> ``` | ``` |

#### Checking a Model for Inconsistencies

To check your `IDocumentModel` for potential inconsistencies call `TestDataGenerator.checkModel(…​)`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` public final class TestDataGenerator {  	//...  	public static ITdgCheckModelResult checkModel( 			final IDocumentModel documentModel, 			final ITdgContentSettings contentSettings, 			final ITdgTechSettings techSettings) 			throws TdgModellingException, TdgInternalException { 		        // ... 			}      // .. } ``` |
```

The method most importantly requires the `IDocumentModel`, which shall be checked.
Furthermore, `ITdgContentSettings` and `ITdgTechSettings` must be passed to provide the necessary configuration.
To obtain a `IDocumentModel` as well as the two settings instances, the TDG library provides some utility methods.
For example, see the following usage example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 ``` | ``` public class CheckModelExample {  	public static void main(final String[] args)         throws TdgModellingException, TdgInternalException {  		// Read the DocumentModel 		Path pathToDocumentModel = Path.of(args[0]); 		IDocumentModel documentModel = SerializationUtils.readDocumentModelExpanded(pathToDocumentModel);  		// Get the settings 		ITdgContentSettings contentSettings = new TdgContentSettingsBuilder().build(); 		ITdgTechSettings techSettings = new TdgTechSettingsBuilder().build();  		// Run check model, check exceptions 		ITdgCheckModelResult checkModelResult; 		try { 			checkModelResult = TestDataGenerator.checkModel( 					documentModel, 					contentSettings, 					techSettings 			); 		} catch (TdgModellingException ex) { 			//The error may be connected to specific rules: 			if (!ex.getErroneousRules().isEmpty()) { 				ex.getErroneousRules().forEach(LOG::error); 			} 			throw ex; 		} catch (TdgInternalException ex) { 			// Unexpected error 			throw ex; 		}  		// Write the check model report as a json-file 		Path dstFile = pathToDocumentModel.getParent().resolve(documentModel.getHeader().getId() + "_check_model.json"); 		try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(dstFile.toFile(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) { 			SerializationUtils.serializeCheckModelReport(checkModelResult.checkModelReport(),                 fileWriter); 		} catch (IOException ex) { 			throw new RuntimeException(ex); 		}     }  } ``` |
```

In detail, you may use:

* `SerializationUtils.readDocumentModelExpanded(Path pathToModel)` to create a `IDocumentModel` from a file on your disc.
* `TdgContentSettingsBuilder` to create a default instance of `ITdgContentSettings`.
* `TdgTechSettingsBuilder` to create a default instance of `ITdgTechSettings`.
* `SerializationUtils.serializeCheckModelReport(…​)` to serialize the Report as an A12 Document.

As a start, both settings can be used as provided by default.
If needed, use the respective builder to configure each setting individually.
The return value of `checkModel(…​)` is an `ITdgCheckModelResult`, which provides detailed information about rule contradiction or fields which cannot be filled.
For more details on sophisticated exception handling see the [Common Exception](#txt:quickref:tdg-lib-exceptions) section.

It is also possible to get the report as a HTML file.
For that purpose we can use the `ReportUnfillableEntitiesToHtml.writeReport(…​)` method as shown in the example below:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` public class CheckModelExample {      public static void main(final String[] args) throws TdgModellingException, TdgInternalException {  	// (...)  	// Write the check model report as a html-file 	ReportUnfillableEntitiesToHtml r = 		new ReportUnfillableEntitiesToHtml(checkModelResult.checkModelReport(), 			Locale.ENGLISH, false); 	try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pathToDocumentModel.toString() 				.replace(".json", ".html")); 			PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fos, true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) { 		r.writeReport(pw); 		pw.flush(); 	} catch (Exception ex) { 		throw new RuntimeException(ex); 	}     } } ``` |
```

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | For the creation of the html-file the `tdg-utils` module must be integrated.  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-utils</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> </dependency> ``` | ``` |

#### Creating Test Data

To generate test data, i.e. to generate a set of A12 Documents, that satisfy the rules defined in the `IDocumentModel` use the
`TestDataGenerator.createTestData(…​)` function:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` public final class TestDataGenerator {  	//...  	public static ITdgTestDataResult createTestData( 			final IDocumentModel documentModel, 			final TdgDataGoal dataGoal, 			final ITdgContentSettings contentSettings, 			final ITdgTechSettings techSettings) 			throws TdgModellingException, TdgInternalException { 		// ... 	}      // ... } ``` |
```

The usage is very similar to the check model variant.
The only difference is that additionally a
`TdgDataGoal` is required.
All other parameters can be obtained as described in the previous example.
In order to decide which data goal to choose, read the [data goals](#txt:quickref:datagoals) section for detailed information on each data goal.
The chosen data goal strongly influences the generation process and output of the test data.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do not use data goal `TdgDataGoal.CUSTOM_1`, which only serves as a placeholder for custom data goal implementations! |

The created `ITdgTestDataResult` most importantly contains a list of `ITdgResult`.
The number of Result Documents greatly depends on the given data goal and Document Model.
The `ITdgResult` itself contains the actual test data in form of Kernel’s `DocumentV2` interface as well as additional information such as validation or data goal specific information.
For instance, you may use `SerializationUtils.writeDocument(…​)` to serialize the produced Document, as shown in the following code excerpt:

```

```

It is also possible to obtain the test data and the related statistics in the format of an [Excel File](#txt:quickref:excel) using the `TdgExcelFileProducer` class as demonstrated in the example below:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` public class CreateTestdataExample {      public static void main(final String[] args) throws TdgModellingException, TdgInternalException {  	// (...)  	// Write testdata and statistic to Excel file 	final TdgExcelFileProducer excelFileProducer = new TdgExcelFileProducer(documentModel, 		new File(pathToDocumentModel.toString().replace(".json", ".xlsx")), 		Locale.ENGLISH, testDataResult);  	excelFileProducer.updateAndSaveFile(); 	excelFileProducer.close();     } } ``` |
```

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | For the generation of the Excel file the `tdg-utils` module must be integrated.  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-utils</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> </dependency> ``` | ``` |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Excel file should only be a provider of an easy readable view on data and statistics, do not use it for further processing. The file’s content structure is subject to unannounced changes and not standardized. |

#### Common Exceptions

The `TestDataGenerator` API throws two basic types of exception:

* `TdgModellingException`, indicating an anticipated error, which can (potentially) be fixed by the user.
* `TdgInternalException`, indication an unsuspected error or bug.

In case a `TdgModellingException` is thrown, consider inspecting the concrete exception’s subtype as well as the presented rule names via
`TdgModellingException.getErroneousRules()` to identify the issue.
Potentially, the error can be fixed right away.
Commonly used extensions of the `TdgModellingException`, which can be checked on demand are:

* `TdgRuleParseException`: error while parsing the Rules' error condition text, the condition text may be malformed.
* `TdgInconsistentDocumentModelException`: the Document Model is inconsistent, try running `TestDataGenerator.checkModel(…​)` instead to obtain a detailed analysis.
* `TdgUnsupportedConstellationException`: The Rules include a known feature or constellation of features, which is not (yet) supported by TDG.
  This issue may only be solved by re-writing error conditions (if possible).

In contrast, a `TdgInternalException` indicates an unexpected internal error, which most likely cannot be resolved immediately.
In such a case, please consider contacting the TDG team or open a bug ticket in order to find a solution.

## Main Concepts

### Overview Over the TDG Workflow

Basically, TDG takes a `DocumentModel` and maps it to a [satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories), expressed in the
[SMT-LIB-Language](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/).
Then, it repetitively calls [SMT-Solvers](#txt:quickref:smt-solvers), which find a solution for the SMT-problem.
That solution is mapped back to a `DocumentV2`.

![DataGoals](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/04_01_01.png)

**Input of TDG**

* Document Model
* Settings
* [Plugins](#txt:quickref:plugins): (Optional), limited support for Command Line Tool.

**Output of TDG**

* Test data in form of a `DocumentV2` (corresponding to the provided Document Model)
* Report about rule contradictions in the Document Model (if present)

### SMT Solvers

The Test Data Generator basically maps the A12 Validation Language to the
[SMT-LIB](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/) language and uses
[SMT-Solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories)
to create valid test data.

By default, TDG uses the [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SMT-Solver (version 4.13.3), which is licensed under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

But, TDG can also be configured to run with [Yices 2](https://yices.csl.sri.com/) (stable, version 2.6.5) or [CVC5](https://cvc5.github.io/) (experimental, version 1.2.0) as Solvers.
However, those solvers have to be obtained manually.

In contrast to previous TDG versions (i.e., versions 3.X and lower), the user is no longer required to provide a "SMT-Solver" directory.
If the use of a different SMT-Solver is desired, see the respective usage chapter for more details:

* For the Command Line Tool, see [here](#txt:quickref:commandline).
* For usage as a library, see [here](#txt:quickref:tdg-library).

### Repetitions, MaxRep and MinRep

Groups can be repeatable in A12. They have the *Repeatability* property, which is the maximum amount of instances that are allowed to be created for the group.
The *Repeatability* can have fairly large values.

TDG creates one or more variables in SMT-Lib for every repetition of a group and every repetition of a field.
The SMT-Solvers then decide, which entity is filled in which repetition, and which is not.

For large values of the repeatability of a group, the resulting SMT-Problem would grow disproportionately, if TDG would map every allowed repetition.
Too big SMT-Problems result in big memory usage and long computing times, which can easily exceed the limits of a normal computer.

Therefore, TDG uses a setting called `maxRep`, which defines the maximal repetitions of a group that TDG maps to the SMT-Problem.
For higher repetitions, no variables are created.
They are treated as being not filled.

Sometimes, there are groups which **have to be filled for a minimum number of times**, which is guarded with a rule respectively.

In this example, group `/A` always has to be filled at least five times:

```
NumberOfFilledGroups(/A*) < 5
```

For this case, TDG uses the annotation `A12_TDG_MINREP`, where the value has to be an integer with the minimum of repetitions needed.
The value of `A12_TDG_MINREP` overwrites `maxRep` for this specific group.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | As `maxRep` is a variable setting for each data production, we recommend to always use the `A12_TDG_MINREP` annotation, if a group has to be repeated more than once to receive valid data. |

Overview over settings for repetition:

| Property | Setting for | Defined in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Repeatability* | specific group | Document Model (group property) |
| `A12_TDG_MINREP` | specific group | Document Model (as annotation) |
| `maxRep` | entire production | TDG settings |

The actual number of Repetitions for a group is calculated like this:

```
Minimum(Repeatability, Maximum(A12_TDG_MINREP, maxRep))
```

Examples:

| Group | *Repeatability* | MaxRep | Value of `A12_TDG_MINREP` | Repetitions with variables in the SMT-Problem |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /A | 10 | 5 | - | 5 |
| /B | 2 | 5 | - | 2 |
| /C | 10 | 5 | 7 | 7 |
| /D | 2 | 5 | 7 | 2 |

The standard value for `maxRep` in A12 is three.
The `maxRep` value can be set in the TDG settings.
For smaller Document Models, a higher `maxRep` may be feasible.
Depending on the Document Model, the need of memory and computing power can increase dramatically, if `maxRep` is increased.

### Bound Fields and Free Fields

TDG divides the fields of the Document Model in **bound** fields and **free** fields:

**Bound fields** are fields whose value is referenced in one of the rules of the Document Model.

For Example:

```
[/A/field1] > 5
```

The field `/A/field1` is a **bound field**.

**Free fields** are fields whose value is never referenced in the rules of the Document Model.
As long as on the *filling* of a field is referenced, a field remains a free field.

For Example:

```
FieldIsFilled(/A/field2) And FieldIsFilled(/A/field3)
```

The fields `/A/field2` and `/A/field3` are still regarded as **free fields** (as long as their value is not referenced in another rule).

Both types of fields are treated differently: While bound fields have a variable for filling and one or more variables for the value in the SMT-Lib mapping, free fields only have a variable for filling.

**Note:** Groups never have a value.
Therefore, every group has one variable for filling in the SMT-Lib mapping.

### Data Goals

#### Introduction

Different test applications have different requirements for the used test data.

For Example:

* **Smoke tests** should avoid long runtimes.
  Therefore, less filled datasets are desired.
* **Regression tests** before releases should test every detail of the application.
  Therefore, datasets with high test coverage are needed.

Consequently, TDG provides different *data goals* in order to define the desired type of data set which should be created.

##### TODAY-Handling and Rules of SeverityType `WARNING`

Document Models can contain Validation Rules which contain the [`TODAY`-language construct.](#txt:quickref:today-handling)
In some cases it is not possible to fill all fields without a specific *today-value*.

The Validation Rules in the Document Model can be of SeverityType `ERROR` or `WARNING`.
Rules with SeverityType `ERROR` are never violated in the resulting datasets (except for the data goal `NEGATIVE` which intentionally violates at least one rule).
In some Document Models, there are fields which can only be filled while violating rules of SeverityType `WARNING` though.

As a result, often there is a tradeoff between filling of fields and the benefit of having no fixed *today-value* or no violation of rules of SeverityType `WARNING`.
This trade-off is treated differently for each data goal.

##### Non-Linearity

Finally, TDG has to deal with the problem of *non-linearity*: Non-linearities are multiplications of more than one field or divisions in which there is at least one field in the divisor.

If non-linearities occur, the SMT-Solvers have to use totally different algorithms which are significantly slower compared to their linear counterparts.
Moreover, the Solvers often do not provide an answer for non-linear problems ([Non-linear integer problems are not decidable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38320934/why-is-non-linear-real-arithmetic-decidable-while-non-linear-integer-arithmetic)).

Because of this, TDG eliminates any non-linearity by a complex pre-definition algorithm.
The algorithm works with heuristics.
Therefore, it’s always possible, that the resulting datasets are **not perfect** with respect to the test requirements regarding **fields, which are used in non-linearities**.

![DataGoals](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/04_02_01.png)

#### Minimal Dataset

*The minimal dataset is a dataset which is minimally filled.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | Minimal datasets are used for **smoke tests** or **manual tests**, to get a valid dataset with as little filling as possible. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | 1 |
| Commandline Capital | `I` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | Minimal datasets try to avoid the need of *today* or warnings. Higher filling is accepted in exchange. |
| Order | The entities are set to "not filled" invers to their order in the Document Model. Therefore, if only one of several entities has to be filled, only the first one is filled. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | The minimal number of repetitions needed. |

#### Maximal Dataset

*The maximal dataset is a dataset which is maximally filled.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | Maximal datasets are used for **manual tests**, to get a well-filled dataset. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | 1 or 2 |
| Commandline Capital | `X` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | If there are *today*-critical rules or warnings, TDG produces two maximal datasets:  `PRIO_NO_WARNINGS_NO_HEUTE_BEFORE_FILL`: TDG tries to avoid the need of a *today*-value and warnings. Less filling is accepted in exchange.  `PRIO_FILL_BEFORE_NO_WARNINGS_NO_HEUTE`: TDG tries to fill the dataset maximally. The need of a *today*-value and warnings are accepted in exchange. |
| Order | The entities are filled according to their order in the Document Model. Therefore, if only one of several entities can be filled, only the first one is filled. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | Maximal umber of allowed repetitions (up to `maxRep`). |

#### Root Group Datasets

Definition: The *root groups* are the groups on the lowest possible level, with more than one element on that level.

**Example 1:** The Document Model has the following structure (where A, AA, AB, B, BA and C are groups, field\* are fields):

```
├──/A
│   ├──/A/AA
│   │   ├──/A/AA/field1
│   │   └──/A/AA/field2
│   └──/A/AB
│       ├──/A/AB/field3
│       └──/A/AB/field4
├──/B
│   ├──/B/BA
│   │   └──/B/BA/field5
│   └──/B/field6
└──/C
    └──/C/field7
```

The root groups are `/A`, `/B` and `/C`.

**Example 2:** The Document Model has the following structure (where A, AA, AAA, AAAA and AAAB are groups, field\* are fields):

```
└──/A
    └──/A/AA
        └──/A/AA/AAA
            ├──/A/AA/AAA/AAAA
            │   ├──/A/AA/AAA/AAAA/field1
            │   └──/A/AA/AAA/AAAA/field2
            └──/A/AA/AAA/AAAB
                ├──/A/AA/AAA/AAAA/field3
                └──/A/AA/AAA/AAAA/field4
```

The root groups are `/A/AA/AAA/AAAA` and `/A/AA/AAA/AAAB`.

*Root group datasets fill one root group maximal, the others minimal.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | Root group datasets are used for **automated tests** or **manual tests**, if special parts of the data model are tested. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | TDG produces as many datasets per root group as needed for every entity to be filled at least once. This can result in one or more datasets per root group. |
| Commandline Capital | `R` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | The first dataset for a root group tries to avoid the need of a *today*-value or warnings.  The other datasets for a root group accept the need of a *today*-value or warnings. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | Root group, dataset is created for: Maximal possible up to `maxRep`.  Others: Minimal needed. |

#### All Fields Datasets

*All fields datasets create a set of datasets where every entity is filled at least once, if possible.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | All fields datasets are used for **automated tests** or **manual tests**, if every field should be entered at least once and no repetitions are tested. Therefore, this data goal produces fewer datasets with a lower degree of filling compared to [datasets of high coverage](#txt:quickref:datagoal-high-coverage).  For example, these datasets are used by an automated [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)-test to find vulnerabilities of a portal. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | As many as needed to have each entity filled at least once. |
| Commandline Capital | `A` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | TDG starts with creating datasets without a *today-value* and warnings.  If there are entities which could never be filled that way, TDG creates datasets, which accept a *today-value* and warnings and fills these entities there. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | The entities only have to be filled in one repetition. Therefore, normally just the first repetition is filled. In rare case it’s necessary to fill higher repetitions in order to fill entities at all. |

#### High Test Coverage Datasets

##### Introduction

These datasets contain a lot of interesting properties, such as extreme and special values or logical branches.
We call these properties ***states***.
If a state can be reached, we call it *reachable*, otherwise, we call it *unreachable*.
A state is unreachable, if it’s in conflict with the properties of the fields or with one of the rules.

*Datasets with High Test Coverage are datasets which contain all reachable defined states.*

##### Overview Over the Defined States

| Type | Defined states |
| --- | --- |
| States regarding filling of groups and fields | - Entity is filled.  - If repeatable, every number of repetitions up to `maxRep`.  - Entity is not filled, while its parent is. |
| States regarding values of fields | **Numbers:**  Minimum, Maximum, smallest positive number, biggest negative number, Zero  **Dates:**  29th Feb of actual year. In Addition, the filling is very sophisticated for dates.  **Enums:**  At least two different values.  **Strings (Bound fields):**  One value from the known string constants. Another which is not from the known string constants.  **Strings (Free fields):**  Minimal length (no spaces), maximal length (no spaces), maximal length (with spaces), length between min and max (no spaces), length between min an max (with spaces) |
| States from logical branches | If there are different options, to not violate a rule, each of this logical branches will be used in at least one repetition in at least one dataset. |
| States from [plugins](#txt:quickref:plugins) | Plugins can define additional states. |

##### Properties of Datasets With High Test Coverage

These datasets contain the Highest Test Coverage TDG offers.
Normally, this data goal contains the highest number of datasets, the single datasets are huge and consequently take the **largest computation time** for their creation.

Every **defined state** will either be considered unreachable or it will be reached in one of the resulting datasets.
TDG tries to put as many states in each dataset as possible.
Afterwards the datasets are **filled up** by sophisticated **filling-values**.

##### P-Constraints

This data goal also provides a very sophisticated handling of **non-linearities**: States, which are connected to a non-linearity in any way are called *p-constraints*.
Unfortunately it is not possible to guarantee that every p-constraint is satisfiable.
However, based on sophisticated heuristics, TDG tries to satisfy as many p-constraints as possible.

##### Summary

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | High test coverage datasets are used for **automated tests** to achieve the highest possible test coverage, e.g. to test an application before a release. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | As many as needed in order to capture every reachable state. |
| Commandline Capital | `H` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | There are two kinds of datasets:  Datasets with no *today-value* and warnings: All states, which can be placed here, are placed here.  Dataset, which accept a *today-value* and warnings: The other states are placed here. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | Maximal number of allowed repetitions (up to `maxRep`). |

#### Negative Datasets

*Negative datasets violate one validation rule while being filled as sparsely as possible.*

The rule might be violated in any iteration up to `maxRep`.
Rules with non-linearities are ignored here.
If it’s not possible to only violate a rule, no dataset is created for that rule.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | Negative datasets are used for **automated tests** or **manual tests**, to test, if validation errors and warnings are handled in the intended way. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | For each rule of the data model a dataset is created, which only violates that rule. If that is not possible for a rule, or the rule contains a non-linearity, it’s ignored. |
| Commandline Capital | `N` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | Negative datasets try to avoid the need of a *today-value* or warnings, if that is possible while the intended rule is violated. |
| Order | The entities are set to "not filled" inverse to their order in the Document Model. Therefore, if only one of several entities has to be filled, only the first one is filled. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | The minimal repetition needed. |

#### Datasets Ignoring the Rules

*Datasets which ignore the rules just fill up all the fields with values.
The datasets are valid regarding the formal attributes of the fields.
They are normally violating a lot of the Validation Rules though.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Typical Use Case | This datasets are used to check print layouts. In these scenarios all fields should be filled and no validation is performed. |
| Numbers of Created Datasets | Normally just one dataset is produced. This can be changed by setting the minimal number of datasets. |
| Commandline Capital | `V` |
| [Today](#txt:quickref:today-handling)/Warnings | Irrelevant, as rules are ignored. |
| Order | Irrelevant, as rules are ignored. |
| [Repetitions](#txt:quickref:max-rep) | `maxRep` |

### Today-Handling

#### Introduction

![Today](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/04_05_01.png)

The A12 Kernel Validation Language has the `Today` language construct, which returns the day on which the data is validated.
There is also the `Now` language construct, which returns the point in time at which the data is validated.
In this chapter, we only refer to `Today`, but everything said also applies to `Now` accordingly.

As the test data generation can take some time, the test data is normally created prior to the execution of the test.
Therefore, at the time of the test data generation, the value of `Today` is unknown.

Handling `Today` turned out to be extremely complicated in concrete projects, as the Validation Rules can practically define anything.
The `Today`-handling of TDG is the result of experience from several concrete projects.
The TODAY concept does not cover everything that is expressible by A12 Validation Rules, however it covers all the cases that occurred in praxis.

Typical use cases for `Today` are:

| # | Use Case | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The data starts to be valid at a given point of time in the future. | A form starts to be usable at the following calendar year, but has to be tested before. |
| 2 | Lower limit for a datefield depends on `TODAY`. | A Person has to be younger than a special age. The birthdate is entered in a field. As TDG tries to produce edge cases, it’s probable, that a dataset produced, where the person is exactly that age minus one day. Therefore, the data will be invalid at the next day. |
| 3 | Automatic calculation of a field, depending on `TODAY` | This rule would make the test data valid for only one day:  `[/A/dateField] != Today`  This leads to the case in which test data created with a TODAY=01.01.2021 is only valid at this date. When the same test data is reused on the next day (i.e. 02.01.2021) it already became invalid. |
| 4 | Filling of fields depends on the month of `TODAY` | Fields can only be filled during a specific time of the year. |
| 5 | Possible values depend on `TODAY` | A field contains a tax rate. Only defined tax rates can be entered. Some rates have a validity date, for example the tax on sales was reduced in Germany from 1st of July until 31st of December 2020. |

#### Definitions and Assumptions

* The test for which the test data is created, might set a *today-value*, which simulates that the test is performed on that day.
* It’s preferable **not** to have the need to set that *today-value*, if possible.
* It’s preferable to generate test data, which are valid as long as possible, beginning with the day of the test data generation.
* If it’s required to have a *today-value* set to have some fields filled or to reach special cases in the [High Test Coverage](#txt:quickref:datagoal-high-coverage), it’s preferable to generate some testcases without a *today-value* and some with a *today-value*.
  In the latter case, the problematic fields are filled or the problematic states are reached.
* Time passes only in direction towards the future.
  Therefore, no test data are produced for the past.

#### Today-Handling in the Command Line Tool

You basically have three options regarding `Today` in the Command Line Tool:

1. You allow the creation of datasets with *today-value* (standard).
   If you realize, that all or too many datasets have a *today-value*, you can try to reduce the *duration* with the [`--duration`-parameter](#txt:quickref:commandline-options).
   This might reduce the datasets with *today-value*.
2. You forbid the creation of datasets with *today-value* by setting
   [`--noToday`](#txt:quickref:commandline-options).
   Use this setting if the rules allow the data to be valid from the production day on for a period of time or if your test-tool does not support the setting of a *today-value*.
   If the test data generation is not possible without a *today-value* (Csp is UNSAT, [report about rule contradictions](#txt:quickref:ruleContradictions)), you should reduce the *duration* with the [`--duration`-parameter](#txt:quickref:commandline-options).
   This might make the test data generation possible again.
   Be aware, that there are cases (like use case 1) where you always need a *today-value*.
3. You set a fixed *today-value* with the [`--today`-parameter](#txt:quickref:commandline-options).
   TDG then only guarantees that the produced test data is valid on that day.

**`Today`-Values in the Command Line Tool**

It’s not possible to create test data which are valid for a period of time.
Only points of time can be validated.
Therefore, the Command Line Tool will create a set of dates, starting with day of production, adding `CEIL(duration / 13)` days, until *duration* is reached.

The created data will be valid on those dates.
It’s assumed that the data are also valid between those dates too.
If that is not the case the responsible rules are called *weird*.

**Properties of the Produced Data:**

* If a resulting dataset has no *today-value*, it will be valid from the production day on for *duration* days (assuming that there are no weird `Today`-rules).
* If a resulting dataset has a *today-value*, it will be valid on that day.

#### Dive Deeper: What TDG Does

The Test Data Generator takes two settings for handling `Today`:

| Setting | Type | `ITdgContentSettings` | [Command Line Tool](#txt:quickref:commandline-options) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Today is a variable | boolean | `todayIsVariable()` | Standard: `true`  `--noToday`, `--today`: `false` |
| `Today-Values` | `Set<LocalDate>` | `todayValuesRules()` | Standard: 14 Today-values, starting from `now` until `now + 366` days.  `--duration`: Up to 14 Today-Values, starting from `now` until `now + duration` days |

The main setting is `todayIsVariable()`, which will lead to two different modes:

##### Today-Mode 1: Today Is NOT a Variable

This mode is suitable if the rules allow the test data to be valid for a given period starting from the day of production.

TDG will copy all rules containing `Today` for every value in the `Today-Values` and add the resulting constraints to the `Csp`.
The result is that the produced test data are forced to be valid for all given `Today-Values`.

Example:

The test data are produced by the Command Line Tool on January 1st 2021 with the `--noToday`-option.
TDG will copy all rules with `Today` for the following `Today-Values`:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-01-01 | 2022-07-23 |
| 2021-01-30 | 2021-08-21 |
| 2021-02-28 | 2021-09-19 |
| 2021-03-29 | 2021-10-18 |
| 2021-04-27 | 2021-11-16 |
| 2021-05-26 | 2021-12-15 |
| 2021-06-24 | 2022-01-02 |

The Command Line Tool creates 14 `Today-Values`, starting at the day of production and adding `CEIL(366 / 13) = 29` days until the day of production plus 366 days is reached.
By dividing by 13 every month in that year is hit and the day of the month also changes.
The purpose of that procedure is to hit as many thinkable cases as possible.

Let’s apply this to Use Case 2: A person must be younger than 18 years old.
TDG ensures that they are also younger than 18 on Jan 2nd 2022; therefore they have to be born on Jan 3rd 2004 or later.

The **resulting datasets** will have the following **qualities**:

* No dataset will have a *today-value* set.
* The resulting test data will be valid for all the 14 `Today-Values`.
  It’s assumed that it’s also valid at every day during this year.

##### Today-Mode 2: Today Is a Variable

This mode is suitable for models with more complicated today-rules, for example use cases 3, 4 and 5. TDG will try to avoid the *today-value*, if it’s possible:

TDG will translate `Today` as a variable to the `Csp` and will also create so called *Nice-To-Have-Constraints*:
The first *Nice-To-Have-Constraint* is always setting the `Today`-variable to the day of production.
The others are copies of the `Today`-rules for every `Today-Value` given in the settings.

TDG will try to put the *Nice-To-Have-Constraints* into the Csp, if possible.
Depending on the [data goal](#txt:quickref:datagoals), this might happen before or after the other constraints.

The **resulting datasets** will have the following **qualities**:

* Test Data Generation is always possible.
  If it’s not possible to create a dataset without a *today-value*, all resulting datasets will have one.
* The use of a *today-value* is avoided though, if possible.
  If all desired states can be reached without a *today-value*, none of the resulting dataset will have one.
  If it’s possible to create test data without a *today-value*, but some desired states require a *today-value*, some of the resulting datasets will have a *today-value* set, some won’t.
* If a resulting dataset has no *today-value* set, it will be valid for all of the `Today-Values`, given in the settings.
* If a resulting dataset has a *today-value* set, it will be valid on that day.

## Report About Rule Contradictions

![CSP](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/CSP_VISU.png)

### Introduction

#### The Rule Contradictions Report

A Document Model contains rule contradictions if the model is in conflict per se, or if a group or a field can never be filled without causing a validation error.
We call these groups or fields "Unfillable Entities".
Assuming that a document does not intentionally include unfillable entities, this provides an indication for erroneous rule conditions.
It might also be an indicator for the need of a different [`TODAY`-setting](#txt:quickref:today-handling).

TDG cannot resolve the contradictions leading to an unfillable entity on its own, as this may require the knowledge of a business expert.
However, the "Rule Contradiction Report" provides as much assistance as possible in order to solve the problem.

In the [SME](#txt:quickref:sme), the rule contradictions check is directly included as a feature.
Both the [Command Line Tool](#txt:quickref:commandline) and the [tdg-library](#txt:quickref:tdg-library)
also provide the report as a html-file and in a json-format, respectively.

|  |  |

|  | The screenshots in this chapter are taken from SME. The output of the Command Line Tool has a different UI, but the content is the same. |

#### Components of the Contradiction

A rule contradiction is found if an unfillable entity is found or if the Document Model is in conflict per se.
An entity is unfillable if the assumption that the entity is filled leads to a rule contradiction.
The contradiction consists of **contradiction components**.
There are four types of contradiction components:

* The assumption that an entity is filled.
* Rules from the Document Model.
* [Calcfillings](#txt:quickref:calcfillings): Preconditions of calculations, which implicitly decide, if a calculated field is filled or not.
* [Edge conditions](#txt:quickref:edgeconditions): Implicit properties of the A12 Kernel Rule Language.

**Example of a Rule Contradiction Report:**

![Overview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_02_01_01.png)

Explanation:

| # | Caption | Further Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The full name of the entity. | The Unfillable Entity. |
| 2 | Precondition which leads to the conflict. | The precondition, that the entity is filled. |
| 3 | Rules involved in the conflict. | The validation- and calculation rules from the Document Model. |
| 4 | Filling of automatically calculated fields involved in the conflict. | Preconditions of calculations. They decide about the filling of the calculated field. See [Conflict/ConflictCalcFillings](#txt:quickref:calcfillings). |
| 5 | Edge conditions involved in the conflict. | Implicit properties of the A12 rule language. See [Conflict/Edge conditions](#txt:quickref:edgeconditions). |
| 6 | Subsequent unfillable fields and groups. | Entities, which are unfillable subsequently to the reported Unfillable Entity. See [SubsequentUnfillableEntities](#txt:quickref:subsequentUnfillables). |

### Miscellaneous

#### Allow Fields to be Unfillable

Sometimes there are fields and/or groups which are allowed to be unfillable.
In that case, we do not want to have those fields/groups checked and reported by the rule contradictions report, so we can mark them with the annotation `A12_TDG_UNFILLABLE_OK`.
The value of the annotation is evaluated in the following way:

| Value of `A12_TDG_UNFILLABLE_OK` | Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The value is empty | The annotation always applies | "" or `null`: Annotation always applies. |
| Comma-separated list of variants | Annotation only applies for given variants. | "var1,var2": Annotation applies for variants "var1" and "var2". |
| `NOT` comma-separated list of variants | Annotation applies for all variants except the given ones. | "NOT var1, var2": Annotation applies for all variants except "var1" and "var2". |

*Fields or groups which have the annotation `A12_TDG_UNFILLABLE_OK` are never checked or reported by the rule contradiction report.*

#### Reported Contradictions

For every unfillable entity, **one** contradiction is reported:

* There might be other contradictions caused by the assumption that an entity is filled.
* TDG will only report one contradiction.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We recommend to solve contradictions incrementally: If TDG reports more than one Unfillable Entity, we recommend to solve one conflict at a time. Recreate the rule contradictions report afterward. Repeat this until all problems have been resolved. |

The reported conflict is **minimal**:

* The reported conflict is a **minimal** conflict in the sense, that all the reported Contradiction Components are involved in the conflict.
* In other words, all Contradiction Components are necessary in order to produce the contradiction.
  None of the reported contradiction components can be removed without removing the contradiction.

#### Repetitions

Normally, if an entity is unfillable, all of its repetitions are unfillable.
Only in rare cases, single repetitions are unfillable.
Therefore, only **the first repetition** of Unfillable Entities is reported.

#### Subsequent Unfillables

If an entity `/A/B` is unfillable, and an entity `/A/C` can only be filled if `/A/B` is also filled, `/A/C` is listed in section "Subsequent Unfillable" of `/A/B` and is not reported separately.

#### Emphasized Rule Parts

Parts of rule conditions which are relevant for the contradiction are emphasized.
Not emphasized parts of the rule conditions have no influence on the contradiction.

### Details About Conflict Components

#### Calcfillings

The **preconditions** of the calculations decide if that field is **filled or not**:

* A calculated field **is filled** if one of the preconditions for its calculation is fulfilled.
* If none of the preconditions for its calculation is fulfilled, it will **not be filled**.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please keep in mind that the preconditions of the calculations decide about the filling of the calculated fields. This fact is easily overlooked. A lot of conflicts, which occurred in real live applications were caused by ignoring this connection. |

Calculation Rules can occur in the Rules section as well as in the Calculation Fillings section:

* They will be listed in the Rules section if the calculation itself is part of the contradiction.
* They will be listed in the Calculation Fillings section if the filling of the calculated field, decided by the preconditions, is part of the contradiction.

#### Edge Conditions

There are several types of edge conditions:

| Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Filling of groups caused by filling of child. | A group (parent entity) is automatically filled, if one of its child entities is filled. This connection is part of the conflict. |
| Allowed values for a field | A formally invalid value for a field is enforced. This normally refers to field properties, such as minimal or maximal value, allowed values for enumerations etc. |
| String specialties | Special behaviour of strings: This normally refers to string patterns, which cannot match each other. |
| Mandatory fields and groups | A field or a group was marked mandatory. |
| Plugins | A rule or attribute, injected by a plugin, is involved in the conflict. |

When solving the conflict, the edge conditions should always be considered.
As all reported Contradiction Components are relevant, each of the reported edge conditions is relevant for the contradiction.

### How to Solve the Contradiction

#### Basic Procedure

##### Approach I: Check Reported Contradiction Rules and Calculation Fillings

The first approach for the solution of the contradiction is to simply check the reported rules.
It’s very likely that there is an unintended error in the logic or phrasing of the rules, which causes the contradiction.

* Check the preconditions of the calculations in the Calculation Fillings section.
  Keep in mind that these preconditions decide if the calculated field is filled or not.
* Please have in mind that A12 Kernel Rules define the error situation.
  This is easily overlooked.
* Check if the `and` and `or` are correct.
  Check if braces are missing.

If you found an error, correct it and recreate the rule contradictions report.
If the conflict is solved, you’re done.

If you do not find the error by this approach, you’ll have to go on to the second approach.

##### Approach II: Understanding the Contradiction

The second approach is to understand the contradiction.
This can be very difficult, especially if more and complicated rules are involved.

* We recommend to start with the precondition which enforces the Unfillable Entity to be filled.
  It’s helpful to think "Suppose group/field …​ is filled".

In a **contradiction component**, the groups and fields which are **relevant** for the contradiction are **emphasized**.
The single contradiction components are being connected by relevant fields and groups they have in common.

* After you evaluated a contradiction component (i.e. the precondition at the beginning), search for the contradiction components which have common emphasized groups or fields.

  + Keep going through all contradiction components, guided by the emphasized groups or fields.
    From there, you can try to understand how the contradiction components evaluate, given the previously mentioned assumption that the Unfillable Entity "is filled".
* At a certain point, you will find a contradiction.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Example 1 provides a deeper explanation and visualisation of how to try to understand a contradiction. |

#### Example I

Let’s go through the SME rule contradictions report already mentioned:

![Overview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_02_01_01.png)

In our example, the field `/A/fieldSum` is unfillable.
The best way to understand the conflict is to start with the precondition "Suppose, `/A/fieldSum` is filled".

##### Step A

* You start with the precondition "Suppose, `/A/fieldSum` is filled."
* Then, you look for another rule where `/A/fieldSum` is emphasized or for the automatic calculation of that field.
  In our case, the field is automatically calculated:

![Example_1_step_1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_04_02_01.png)

As the calculation is not shown in the Rules section, only the filling of the calculated field is involved in the conflict and not the calculation itself.

As the precondition of the calculation decides about the filling of `/A/fieldSum`, and the precondition is

```
FieldFilled(B/fieldB) and FieldFilled(C/fieldC)
```

we know that `/A/B/FieldB` **and** `/A/C/FieldC` both have to be filled.

##### Step B

* In the calculation rule `/A/addBAndC`, `FieldFilled(C/fieldC)` is emphasized.
  The other parts of the rule are not involved in the contradiction.
  Therefore, keep looking for other rules in which `C/fieldC` is referenced.
  We see that `C/fieldC` is also referenced in `/A/fieldMandatoryAndFieldsCDNotTogether`:

![Example_1_step_2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_04_02_02.png)

* The rule basically says that `/A/B/fieldMandatory` and `/A/C/fieldC` cannot be filled together.
  As `/A/C/fieldC` has to be filled (Step A), we know that `/A/B/fieldMandatory` has to be **not filled**.

**Note:** `/A/D/fieldD` is not relevant for the conflict.
Therefore, it’s not emphasized in the rule condition text.

##### Step C

As `/A/B/fieldMandatory` is a required field, there are edge conditions, basically saying, that if `/A/B/fieldMandatory` is not filled, all of it’s parent-groups cannot be filled.

![Example_1_step_3](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_04_02_03.png)

**This is a contradiction to `/A/fieldSum` being filled**.

##### Solution

The solution of this conflict is a functional decision, which has to be made by the user in accordance to the correct business logic.
Technically, the solution could be to change any of the conflict components:

* Change the preconditions of the calculation
* Allow `/A/C/fieldC` and `/A/B/fieldMandatory` to be filled together.
* Make `/A/B/fieldMandatory` not mandatory.

#### Example II: `TODAY`

In our example, we have a `field1`, which cannot be filled after the year 2021. At the same time, we have a rule `/A/field1NotFilled`, enforcing the filling of `field1`.

We start the report with the `TODAY` value 20/10/2022:

![Example_2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/05_04_03_01.png)

##### No Valid Document at All

There is no valid dataset for this Document Model with these `Today`-settings at all.
Therefore, the report contains no Unfillable Entity.
Instead, you see the message "The Document Model is completely in conflict!" (A).

This may happen independently of `Today`-issues.

##### Today-Values Involved in Conflicts

If `Today` is involved in one of the conflicts, and it’s emphasized, consider to rerun the report with another `TODAY` value (B).

You can see the today-value used by opening the top section of the report ©.
In the SME a `TODAY`-value is always used.

##### Solution

The solution is a functional decision:

* If the report is also valid in 2022, maybe somebody forgot to adjust the year in rule `/A/field1After2021` to 2022.
* If the report is not valid in 2022, restart the report with a `TODAY`-value from 2021 or before.

### Details About the Rule Contradictions json-file

The rule contradictions json-file is created by the **Command Line Tool**.

#### Text With Semantic Information

Some texts in the report are delivered with semantic and formatting information.
This information consists of the following fields:

| Field | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | The blank text. |
| `markdownText` | The text with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-markups. |
| `SemanticInfo` | Semantic information about the text. |
| `SemanticInfo/beginInfo` | The index in `text`, where the semantic information starts (inclusive). |
| `SemanticInfo/endInfo` | The index in `text`, where the semantic information ends (exclusive). |
| `SemanticInfo/semanticType` | The type of the semantic information. |

**Semantic types:**

| semanticType | Explanation | Formatting in markdown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RULE_PART_RELEVANT` | Relevant part in the rule condition. | **bold** |
| `FULLNAME_GROUP` | A fullname of a group. | `monospaced, bold` |
| `FULLNAME_FIELD` | A fullname of a field. | `monospaced, bold` |
| `TEXT_EMPHASIZED` | Emphasized part of the text. | **bold** |
| `TEXT_TECHNICAL` | A technical string. | `monospaced` |

#### Relevant Rule Parts

The report contains the rule conditions enriched with the information of which parts of the rule condition are relevant for the conflict.

* Parts of the rule conditions which are relevant for the conflict are marked as `RULE_PART_RELEVANT`.
  If one of them is left out, the conflict disappears.
* Parts of the rule conditions which are not relevant for the conflict are not marked.
  If those are left out, the conflict does **not** disappear.
  These parts can only occur in or-operations or in or-like-operations like `AtLeastOneFieldFilled`.
* In the rule conditions of the Calcfillings section, the relevant parts of the preconditions are marked as `RULE_PART_RELEVANT`, not the calculated field itself or the calculation.

#### Referenced Entities

Entities referenced in conflict components are called relevant if the conflict disappears when they are left out.

* In the A12 Document, the referenced entities are reported.
  They have a `relevant`-flag which indicates their relevance.

  + They are reported for every conflict component along with the information of whether they are relevant for that conflict component or not.
  + The group `/UnfillableEntities/Conflict/EntitiesReferenced` contains all the entities which are referenced in any conflict component.
    They are marked relevant if they are relevant in any conflict component.
* In the html-report, one can see the relevant entities along with their parents on the right side in a tree-view.
* If you move the mouse over a conflict component,

  + the entities which are relevant in this conflict component are being highlighted in the tree-view.
  + the caption of other conflict components which have relevant entities in common with the currently hovered conflict component are highlighted as well.

## Pretty Values

### Introduction

By default, TDG tries to fill the created datasets with technical interesting values.
In particular, TDG creates extreme and special values or random values.
For string fields, TDG tries to use every allowed character.

A typical TDG default output looks like this:

![TDG default values](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/06_01.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you use TDG for automized tests, we highly recommend to use the values TDG produces by default. In real life applications, we found a lot of errors in our applications by the use of extreme and special values and by using every allowed character. |

### Pretty Values Option

For manual usage, datasets with more readable values might be preferred.
Therefore, TDG has the [option](#txt:quickref:commandline-options) `--valuesPretty` or `-vP`.
If you set this option, TDG tries to create pretty, readable values for all types of fields.

Example of a TDG output with the `--valuesPretty` set:

![TDG pretty values](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/06_02.png)

TDG tries to use Pretty Values for Dates and Numbers.
For Strings, TDG inserts either a single word or a fake sentence, consisting of real words.

### Use Test Data Hints

TDG is capable of creating more realistic data for names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.
This is achieved by adding the annotation `A12_TDG_TDH` to the relevant fields.
The value of the annotation contains the information about which kind of data the field contains:

| Value of annotation `A12_TDG_TDH` | explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `FIRSTNAME` | firstname of a person |
| `LASTNAME` | lastname of a person |
| `BIRTHDAY` | birthday of a person |
| `SALUTATION` | salutation like 'Mr.' or 'Ms.' |
| `TITLE` | academic title |
| `STREET` | name of a street without the street number |
| `STREET_DE` | German street name without the street number |
| `STREET_INT` | international street name without the street number |
| `STREET_NUMBER` | street number |
| `STREET_NUMBER_ADDITION` | addition to the street number |
| `STREET_AND_NUMBER` | street name and number |
| `STREET_AND_NUMBER_DE` | German street name and number |
| `STREET_AND_NUMBER_INT` | international street name and number |
| `ADDRESS_ADDITION` | additional address information |
| `ZIPCODE` | zip code |
| `ZIPCODE_DE` | German zip code |
| `ZIPCODE_INT` | international zip code |
| `CITY` | name of city |
| `CITY_DE` | name of German city |
| `CITY_INT` | name of foreign city |
| `COUNTRY` | name of a country |
| `PHONE` | complete phone number |
| `PHONE_INT` | international part of phone number |
| `PHONE_AREA` | area part of phone number |
| `PHONE_LOCAL` | local part of phone number |
| `EMAIL` | EMail address |
| `WEB_ADDRESS` | web address |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | name of company |
| `COMPANY_NAME_DE` | name of German company |
| `COMPANY_NAME_INT` | name of foreign company |
| `TAX_OFFICE` | A tax office |
| `TAX_NUMBER` | A tax number  (Only for String fields - Do **not** use this Annotation for Custom field type "Steuernummer"!) |

Example output with Test Data hints:

![TDG with test data hints](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/tdg/tdg-docs-public/assets/images/06_03.png)

In this example, the names of the fields are the same as the value of their `A12_TDG_TDH` annotation.
This does not have to be the case.
The fieldnames are not interpreted by TDG.
Only the value of the `A12_TDG_TDH` annotation is relevant in order to create data with test data hints.

For String fields, you can also put more than one of the constants above in the value of the `A12_TDG_TDH` annotation.
They have to be separated by `' '` or by `', '`.
Examples:

| Value of annotation `A12_TDG_TDH` | Example Value |
| --- | --- |
| `FIRSTNAME LASTNAME` | Bob Miller |
| `STREET_AND_NUMBER_DE, ZIPCODE_DE CITY_DE` | Musterstrasse 42, 55555 Musterstadt |

### Counters

Sometimes, the test data should contain a field whose value is a counter.
For this case, annotate the field with the annotation `A12_TDG_COUNTER`.
If the annotation has a value, that value is used as a prefix of the counter.

Please notice:

* TDG only evaluates the `A12_TDG_COUNTER` annotation for fields which are [free fields](#txt:quickref:boundFreeFields).
  For bound fields, the annotation is ignored.
* TDG only evaluates the `A12_TDG_COUNTER` annotation for fields of type String or Number.
* The annotation overwrites the evaluation of the `A12_TDG_TDH` annotation.

### Limitations

The creation of Pretty Values is a "weak" requirement in TDG.
TDG might not be able to use Pretty Values if

* The formal properties of the field forbid the Pretty Values TDG tries to fill in.
  This might be the case if a number field has atypical minimal or maximal values or if a string field has a pattern.
* The field is a [bound field](#txt:quickref:boundFreeFields).
  For bound fields, the values of the fields are chosen by the SMT-Solver.
  TDG still tries to create Pretty Values, but the rules might not allow this.

## Plugins

There are three types of plugins (custom extensions) available for TDG:

* Custom Field Types (CFT)
* Custom Conditions (CC), also called "Application Conditions"
* Specialities

*Custom Field Types* as well as *Custom Conditions* are standard A12 extensions. *Specialities*, however, are TDG specific plugins that allow direct manipulation of the mapping for certain fields of a Document Model.
Specialities require in-depth knowledge of TDG’s internal operations and therefore should only be used as an exception.
Please contact the TDG team if assistance regarding *Specialities* is required, as no further information will be presented here.

Generally, plugins introduce custom logic which cannot be automatically reproduced by the TDG.
For instance, a *Custom Field Type* may correspond to an internal order number, which has a very strict structure.
On the one hand, without providing custom logic TDG cannot generate correct values according to an unknown rule set.
On the other hand, test data production shall not fail because of a missing plugin implementation.
As a consequence, missing plugin implementations are mocked internally by a *neutral* dummy implementation:

* For CFTs: Missing implementations are replaced by Dummy-CFT implementations that generate values according to the CFT-field’s properties (min/max length, pattern), example values may be given by annotations.
* For CCs: Missing implementations are replaced by a neutral Dummy-CC implementation which *never* causes a validation error and has no affect in the rules it is used in.

### Providing CFT Example Values

Instead of providing an actual CFT implementation, it is possible to only provide (valid) example values that shall be used during test data production.
In the Document Model, annotate CFT fields with the annotation `A12_TDG_CUSTOM_FIELDTYPE_TESTDATA` (as a comma separated list of example values) in order to enforce certain values.
A few remarks regarding this approach:

* Annotations are field-specific, i.e. if there are multiple field instances of the same CFT, *all* field instances have to be annotated, annotations on one field are *not* applied to other field instances.
* Annotation values must be valid with respect to the CFT field’s formal restrictions (min/max length, pattern), otherwise they are not used.
* If an actual CFT implementation is provided, the annotation values are ignored, so it is possible to annotate fields first, if no implementation is ready yet.
  Annotations do not need to be removed once the implementation is ready.

### Providing Plugin Implementations

Providing custom implementations is only possible when using TDG as a library.
For the Command Line Tool, unknown plugins are automatically mocked by respective dummy implementations (but annotations are applied).
Custom plugin implementations can be passed via `ITdgContentSettings`.
Note that ***TDG***'s plugin interfaces are *different* to Kernel’s plugin interfaces as TDG requires additional information to *generate* values (instead if only *validating* values).
For custom field types, implement the `ITdgCustomFieldType` interface.
For custom conditions, implement the `ITdgCustomCondition` interface.
For further information and assistance please contact the TDG team.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | For default A12 CFTs a `ITdgCustomFieldType` implementation can be accessed by including the `tdg-cft` package. The package includes an implementation for *Bundesfinanzamtsnummer, Einheitswertaktenzeichen (EWAz), Steuernummer, BIC, BICInternational, IBAN, IBANInternational, Identifikationsnummer, ISIN*, and *StrafAktenzeichen* (some of those require special german tax office information).  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.mgmtp.a12.tdg</groupId>     <artifactId>tdg-cft</artifactId>     <version>7.8.1</version> </dependency> ``` | ```  Add CFTs to the `ITdgContentSettings` via the `TdgCustomFieldTypeFacade`:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` 	//... 	myContentSettingsBuilder.customFieldTypes(TdgCustomFieldTypeFacade.getDefaultCustomFieldTypes());     // .. ``` | ```  However, the `TdgCustomFieldTypeFacade` is considered A12-internal and therefore is not publicly supported and may be subject to unannounced changes. The mentioned plugins are automatically included in the command line tool. |

## Not Implemented Features

### Kernel Language Constructs

Currently, all kernel language constructs are supported by TDG.
However, single constellations may be not implemented.

### Kernel Language Constellations

A kernel language constellation is the usage of a kernel language construct in a special way.
A typical example would be a kernel language construct, used with a filter condition or a semantic index.

We try to close all gaps of not implemented constellations step by step.
However, it’s possible, that there are still some gaps in rare constellations.
In these cases, TDG will throw a `TdgMappingNotImplementedException`, which contains the rules, in which the not implemented constellation was found.

If a `TdgMappingNotImplementedException` is thrown, please do not hesitate to in inform the TDG-Team.

These language constructs are the most probable to be used in an unsupported constellation:

* **String concatenations** are extremely crucial for TDG.
  Most missing constellations are connected with complicated string concatenations.
  Some of them are not representable in the way, TDG currently maps strings to SMT-Lib.
  We are working on a new solution, which completely supports all constellations of string concatenations.
* **Categories** are not supported in some language constructs.
  This is especially the case, if categories are concatenated with other strings.
* **Type conversions** between Numbers, Strings and Dates might not be implemented.
* **Filter conditions or the usage of a semantic index** might not be implemented in rare situations.

### Complicated regular expressions

Complicated regular expressions, might not be implemented:

* Lookarounds
* Regular expressions used together with `PartAs()` constructs or string concatenations, if TDG cannot split up the regular expression accordingly.

### Complicated Non-Linearities

TDG can handle simple non-linearities.
It uses an own algorithm to eliminate such non-linearities.
More complicated non-linearities like calculations of 3rd grade or higher will possibly lead to timeouts and to no solution.
The same is true for irresolvable calculations.

### Complicated or Huge Document Models

The calculation time to find valid data sets increases with the size and the complexity of the document model.
It does not increase linearly.
One single, complicated rule might blow up the runtime totally.
If the test data production leads to a lot of timeouts, it might help to reduce `maxRep` or to increase the timeout.

### TDG Annotations

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Annotation name | Meaning | Link in documentation |
| A12\_TDG\_UNFILLABLE\_OK | Entities marked with this annotation are allowed to be unfillable. These entities are ignored in the CHECK\_FILLING and statistics. | [4.2.1. Allow Fields to be Unfillable](#annotations:unfillableOK) |
| A12\_TDG\_NOT\_ALL\_REPS\_FILLABLE\_OK | If at least one repetition of an entity marked with this annotation can be filled, this entity is not reported by the CHECK\_FILLING. | ---------------------------------------- |
| A12\_TDG\_MINREP | Indicates the minimal repetition of a group for test data generation. | [A12\_TDG\_MINREP Usage](#annotations:minrep) |
| A12\_TDG\_CUSTOM\_FIELDTYPE\_TESTDATA | The value of this annotation contains field values, which are used. This annotation can be used in case the custom field type is not programmatically implemented. | [6.1. Providing CFT Example Values](#annotations:customFieldTypeTestData) |
| A12\_TDG\_COUNTER | Indicates a string field that is used as a counter for data sets.  NOTE: Has to be a free field of type string or number. | [5.4. Counters](#annotations:counter) |
| A12\_TDG\_TDH | Serves as a hint for creating pretty strings: The value of this annotation tells TDG what information to put into the fields value. | [5.3. Use Test Data Hints](#annotations:tdh) |
| \_A12\_TDG\_IGNORE\_CUSTOM\_CONDITIONS | Ignores the custom conditions for rules marked with this annotation. | ---------------------------------------- |

## Migration Instructions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If used as a library, only migrate the TDG version in accordance with the Kernel version used in your project. TDG and Kernel version have to be aligned, i.e. they should match the same -ext release in order to avoid inconsistencies. Within a release line, different TDG and Kernel ext-Release are compatible, however it is not recommended due to potential inconsistencies in third party library dependencies. |

### 2025.06

#### Breaking Changes

* [A12TDG-476] - A12TDG is compiled with Java 21 - Compatibility with java 17 is dropped.
* [A12TDG-451] - `TdgAnnotations` was renamed to `TdgAnnotation`.

#### Breaking Change A12 internal

* [A12TDG-478] - Use ICondition in TDG plugins: The **A12 internal** interfaces `ITdgCustomCondition` and `ITdgSpecialty` are changed from a CSP interface to an A12 interface.
  Conditions have to be provided as an A12 `ICondition` from now on.
  For `ITdgCustomCondition`, the interface is completely redone, for `ITdgSpecialty`, the old functions are deprecated.
  The new interfaces provide an `IConditionBuilder`, which helps to create an `ICondition`.
