# Plasma – The Design System

## Get Started

![Email](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/start-enterprise-example.png)

A12 Plasma is a design system for enterprise applications. These applications, compared to consumer applications, deal with two major requirements:

![Scale and Complexity](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/start_problems.png)

While facing these problems, customer and user still expect a consistent, efficient and - something which became more important over the last years - a nice UI. To help you creating these user interfaces for your project, we have created guidelines, components and patterns.

### Designing an application with A12 Plasma

If you are not familiar with the possibilities A12 Plasma is offering or want to know how to use A12 Plasma in the most efficient way, please take your time to have a look at the following two sections:

#### Designing the application structure

One of the main problems is the sheer quantity of information. This guideline supports you in analyzing your application to define the application structure and its navigation concept. This also helps you to extend your application with future requirements.

[Designing The Application Structure](#_designing_the_application_structure_2)

#### Business Objects

Information or Business Objects are seldom stand-alone components in enterprise applications. Usually they are connected within a certain process or workflow. This guideline will show you the most used workflow in an enterprise application and how you can visualize it with A12 Plasma.

[Working with Business Objects](#_working_with_business_objects)

### A12 Plasma Solutions

Our solutions are grouped in 2 main categories. **Patterns** shows how certain components can be combined to solve requirements in a reusable and most efficient way. **Components** are like ingredients which can be used to build applications or fulfill their role in a certain pattern.

![Components and Patterns](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/start-components-pattern.png)

### Design Principles

**Robustness**

Enterprise applications are dealing with sensitive data, therefore our solutions will be fault tolerant and keep the user in control in order to fulfill their tasks in a safe way.

**Efficiency - Fast and precise**

Be carefully of a user’s time and respect their workflow. Anticipate ways for people to work better and faster with their application. A12 Plasma provide the most efficient way for professional users to do their job.

**Accessibility - Usable by everyone**

Accessibility in design allows users with disabilities to navigate, understand, and use your application. It is important that accessibility is included in all phases of a project and a natural part in the design process.

## Guidelines

Our guidelines provide information on how to use A12 Plasma in the most efficient way.

### Designing The Application Structure

To design an application it is necessary to analyze the information architecture and the processes of a project. In this guideline we will walk you through an example to show how we use our patterns and concepts to refactor an application. The same ideas can be applied when creating an application from scratch.

#### Using Information Architecture For Analysis

To be able to define an application structure and its navigation concept we need to analyze the information structure of our application. In this example we take Outlook 2010 to demonstrate our approach.

![Outlook window](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/outlook-1.png)

When analyzing an application people might start with the most obvious layout areas and analyze the UI components used to rebuild the application. For demonstration we have highlighted 3 areas in the example above. In this example you might see:

* Horizontal Navigation
* Vertical Icon Navigation
* Tree
* Table

But in order to rebuild an application and create the most efficient user experience you need to analyze the actual information structure of the application. This knowledge will also help you to extend the application with future requirements. So how will our example look like if we approach it with this method?

![Information Architecture Example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/outlook-ia.png)

As expressed by the arrows the information is structured in a certain hierarchy. Based on this we can assume that we need a navigation concept to fulfill the following generalized view:

![First level, second level, third level](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/outlook-level.png)

With these findings you can consult the following concept and documentation:

##### Application Frame

This documentation shows you the fundamental layout of our design system and its possibilities for customization.

##### Navigation Concept

How can users navigate to their content? The concept will demonstrate how many levels A12 Plasma supports and how to efficiently create a navigation concept.

The concepts will help us to redesign our example and to create the following screen:

![New Layout of Outlook](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/outlook-new-ia.png)

As you can notice we have used different components and regrouped them compared to the original application. In the next section we will explain these decisions and introduce some laws of UX which you can apply to your projects to create a better user experience.

#### Problem-based requirements and laws of UX

As mentioned in the intro, one of the biggest challenges in enterprise applications is the sheer number of information. More information means more time for users to capture the information, which leads to less efficiency. Therefore in A12 Plasma we always strive to reduce the information density to what is really required to fulfill a certain task or requirement. In this chapter we will explain how you can achieve a better user experience by applying certain UX rules.

##### Hick’s Law - Task appropriateness

Hick’s law recommends to decrease the number and complexity of choices in order to reduce the time it takes for a user to make a decision.

In enterprise applications users spend little time in browsing through different main sections of an application, but rather spend their time in a certain dedicated section to take care of their work. Therefore, instead of using a tab navigation with bold big icons we will use a rather simple horizontal menu as our main navigation. The sole important function for a main navigation is to show which section is currently selected.

![The navigation with big icons is replaced by a simple horizontal menu](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/hickslaw.png)

##### Law of Proximity

Proximity helps users to understand and organize information faster and more efficiently.

This also helps in terms of extensibility of an application. Even when adding a new feature, users will find it faster because it can be placed in an expected area, instead of forcing them to search for it on the interface.

In the following example we are combining the law of proximity with Hick’s law:

![Original and New Navigation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/proximitylaw.png)

##### Fitt’s Law

This law recommends to keep the distance between a user’s task/attention area and the task-related action as short as possible.

Applying this to the example and the task „Reading an email - Reply“ will result in the following approach:

![Hicks Law](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/fittslaw.png)

#### Conclusion

![Hicks Law](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/newold.png)

We hope we were able to walk you through our thoughts and concepts in order to help you create an application with A12 Plasma.

### Applying UX Principles (Checklist)

The A12 framework allows its users to design their applications in multiple ways.

However, if you want to create a consistent usability and a positive user experience, you should keep in mind the following guidelines.

#### Design Best Practices

**Brevity**

Consider shorter expressions to save (head-) space

**Clarity**

Make elements as self-evident as possible

* Example: When choosing labels, ask yourself "Will the user understand what I am referring to or does this wording have another meaning as well?" → e.g. the button "download pdf" is more self-evident than "download" because it offers more detail on what is to be expected.

**Consistency**

Similarities between elements, as well as their differences, should be highlighted through predictable, application-wide structures (e.g. naming structures), rules and conventions.

* Example: In a table, two column headers that both allow the download of a picture should be named similarly: Either ".png picture download" & ".jpg picture download", or ".png download" & ".jpg download". Each pair is named consistently because their naming structure highlights the items' similarities and differences in a predictable pattern.

**Correct formatting**

Be mindful when formatting text. An element may come with its own automatic formatting properties.

* Example: Don’t write button text as upper case. The component comes with its own formatting properties and gets displayed with the intended formatting by default.

**Guidance**

Provide the user with all the information they may need to do their tasks. When unsure, rather give more information (especially when deciding whether to add basic information like headers, titles and labels).

#### Plasma Rules in each Application Section

Details

###### Best practice case

![Footer best practice](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/plasma-rules/Footer1.png)

**Structure**

☐ Please use this structure:

* Major area

  + **(1)** one main action
  + **(2)** one main action’s destructive counterpart

    - Secondary button type:

      * destructive
* Minor area

  + any additional actions (if necessary)
  + The amount of actions that can be shown explicitly depends on the space available.

    - If the space is limited, some or all buttons get hidden using the [Popup Menu component](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/general/popup-menu).

Read more suggestions on the general button positioning [here](#_button_position_order)

**Wording**

☐ Use consistent wording for buttons across the app.

* Example: Use "Save" everywhere instead of using both "Save" and "Yes, save". They mean the same so they should be called the same.

☐ When choosing a wording, consider the following use cases (examples):

*Confirm*

* confirm process

  + "«verb»" – e.g. "Save"
* confirm (having read) instructions

  + If part of a step-by-step process – see *Continue* below
  + Instructions – low risk

    - "Understood"
    - "Got it"
  + Instructions – heavier consequences

    - "Approve"
  + Terms & conditions – heavier consequences

    - "Accept (and continue)"
    - "I + «verb»" – e.g. "I accept"

*Continue*

* continue step-by-step process

  + "Continue"

*Exit*

* close window

  + "Close"
* exit procedure

  + when you do not want to continue with the shown procedure

    - "Cancel"
    - "Cancel «process»"

*Decline*

* see 1) and 2), except: if

  + terms & conditions

    - "Decline (and exit)"

###### Dirty and deletion handling

![Footer dirty handling](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/plasma-rules/Footer2.png)

Unlike in the best practice case, in the use cases of dirty and deletion handling the primary button can be destructive, e.g. because the users need to confirm that they want to discard their changes or that they want to delete something.

**Structure**

☐ Use the structure as described above, except:

* major area

  + **(1)** one main action

    - Primary button type:

      * destructive
  + **(2)** one counter action

    - Secondary button type:

      * default

**Wording**

☐ Read and choose **one** wording option for the same meaning across the app.

☐ Consider the following use cases:

* **delete field**

  + Text: "Deletion cannot be reverted. What do you want to do?"
  + Button pair:

    - "Delete" – primary destructive
    - "Cancel" – secondary
* **unsaved changes**

  + Text: "There are some unsaved changes in the editor. They will be lost. What do you want to do?"
  + Button pair:

    - "Discard changes" as primary destructive button and
    - "Go back" as secondary button
* **warning**

  + Text: "By closing the bulk operation panel, the selection will be cleared. What do you want to do?"
  + Button pair:

    - "Clear selection" as primary destructive and
    - "Cancel" as secondary

##### Icons

Details

In the following table you will find the recommended icons for the most common use cases.

When there are two icons for the same meaning:

* use any of the two as long as you use the same one consistently for the same meaning
* if possible, only one should be used per use case (or their meaning and use must be clearly distinguishable)

| Main use case | Preview | Recommended usage | Google identifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Add** | add | * add item * include | add |
| add circle | add\_circle |
| **Attachment** | attach file | * attach (new) item * (this is an existing) attachment | attach\_file |
| attachment | attachment |
| **Close** | cancel | * cancel, end something * close/hide  Attention: The icon "close" is also used for deleting entries (see "Delete" below) and therefore only recommended when "cancel" is no alternative. | cancel |
| close | close |
| **Copy** | content copy | * copy item  Only recommended for this exact use; for different meanings (e.g. template), use a different icon | content\_copy |
| **Delete** | delete | delete | delete |
| delete forever | final deletion (ie. from inside of bin) | delete\_forever |
| close | delete entry (e.g. from input) | close |
| **Download** | download | download file or item | download |
| **Edit** | edit | * edit item * write something | edit |
| **Folder** | create new folder | create new folder | create\_new\_folder |

| **Success** | check circle | * success  In A12 context already globally used in the widgets [message box](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/business-case/message-box) and [global message box](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/feedback/global-message-box) to express success.  If you need a check symbol in other contexts, we recommend to use the "done" icon (below). | check\_circle |
| done | * (getting something) done * selected, checked | done |
| **Warning** | warning | * warning  In A12 context already globally used in the widgets message box and global message box, but can be used for other purposes, as long as it is distinguishable from these widgets. | warning |

#### Inputs & Buttons

##### Inputs

☐ Use labels wherever it can help guide the user (read [here](#_labels) for more info)

☐ Use placeholder texts if:

* you want to give an example of how to use the field

  + Example: Field label = e-mail; placeholder text = john@company.com

##### Buttons

☐ Label: Choose between "text only" / "text + icon" / and "icon only" labels, see [here](#_how_to_use) how

☐ Wording consistency: Whenever it makes sense, make sure to use the same expression (and possibly icon) for the same usage all across the app.

###### "Add item" button

![Add buttons example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/plasma-rules/Add.png)

**(1)** Use of "Add" Material icon is preferred – wherever it is possible.

* This makes the function of the button very obvious.
* Default buttons where you can’t add an icon in the Form Model: see [here](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/%asciidoc%/SME/sme-fm-ba-docs/index.html#tab%3Achapter03%3Amodel-settings-tab2)

**(2)** Use of the "…​" (item name) is preferred, unless

* the item name is too long – e.g. several words
* space is not available

### Creating Forms

![Address form with Fields for ZIP code, city and country](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_intro.png)

#### Introduction

Forms are a fundamental part of A12 based applications. They can be found in all kind of situations, e.g.:

* Product site
* Tax document
* Survey report

This guideline shall support you in creating or adjusting forms of any complexity.

The first part covers how to structure the information of forms independently from their visual appearance.

The second part takes care of how to display forms to your end users with the help of a good layout.

At the end of this section, you will find usability tips for common problems.

#### Video Tutorial

In the following video tutorial *"From Paper to Digital Form"* you can see how to easily transfer a paper form into a user-friendly digital one in 6 steps.

The covered topics are i.a. select options, layout, help text and navigation.

*Materials for download:*

[Paper Form (PDF)](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/Paper_Form.pdf),
[Digital Form (PDF)](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/Digital_Form.pdf)

#### Information Structure

As a first step, it is important to structure your form. Here, we are only taking care of the raw “data” of the form, not the visual appearance.

A well structured form supports:

* The overall readability
* Users in skim reading

To achieve these goals, you can:

* Arrange content in “Groups”
* Use “Group Titles”
* Nest “Groups” to build “Group Hierarchies”

##### Groups

When building a form, try to group its content. For example, client-related information like name, address and phone should be part of one group.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Content is grouped |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Content is not grouped |

##### Group Titles

A group title describes the content of a group. By providing it, users can identify the content of a form more easily. They do not need to read over the whole form to figure out which part is of interest to them.

![3 Groups of different size with Group Titles](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_sectionTitle_example_0001.png)

A group title should be meaningful. Therefore:

* Try to find summarizing titles
* Avoid to just copy the label texts from the group’s fields.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Group Title for ZIP code and city Fields is Address |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Group Title for ZIP code and city Fields is Zip code and city, too |

However, in case, there is just one field inside a group, reusing its label as a group title can be valid. Consider shortening the group title and/or field’s label to reduce redundancies.

##### Group Hierarchies

Nesting groups can improve the general effect of grouping even more. However, you should not overdo it. Try to limit yourself to a maximum of three nesting levels for a good readability. Otherwise the form creates the impression of being complicated.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Flat hierarchy |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Complex hierarchy |

Keep in mind: Even if the theoretical information structure of your form calls for nesting, you do not need to necessarily do so. Your end users will most likely not care too much about whether a certain group should have been part of another one or not. A flat hierarchy is more desired than an accurate one.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To flatten group hierarchies consider:  * Restructuring hierarchies * Dissolving sub groups * Putting sub groups on a higher hierarchy level * Outsourcing groups to a new view |

#### Layout

After setting up the form’s information structure, you need to decide on how to display it to your end users.

The layout of a form defines the base for its visual appearance. The most common layouts are:

![Layouts: Row-Oriented, Column-Oriented and a mix of both.](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_layout_example_0001.png)

There are no rules, when to use which layout. It depends on your form’s content, goal and complexity as well as the available space and the overall use case. For example, a column-oriented layout might be a good choice for both:

* A simple form to change a password
* A complex insurance form

When using these layout types, there are some **pitfalls** to be aware of. The section below lists up tips to avoid the most common ones.

##### Row-Oriented

Keep the number of form elements, like fields or buttons, next to each other small: A PC screen is typically wider than it is high. So, using the whole width seems to be the best approach to save space. However, with a certain amount of form elements next to each other, a form gets really hard to read. To avoid this, consider:

* Using a column-orientated layout approach
* Reducing the width of form in Master-Detail-View

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Less form elements in two rows |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Many form elements in one row |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please note that you are currently limited in modeling the width for Master and Detail View. The SME only allows to define a desired width for the Detail View. That means that A12 tries to set the width of the Detail View to the intended size if possible. The Master View is automatically adjusted. |

##### Column-Oriented

Keep content that belongs together close to each other: Avoid large gaps between related content inside of one column.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  No gap between content of one column |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Large gap between content of one column |

Keep the number of columns next to each other small: If a form consists of too many columns, it gets hard to read.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Less columns next to each other |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Many columns next to each other |

Try to keep the height of a column small: Don’t force end users to scroll up and down endlessly in order to read the content of columns next to each other (as illustrated with the blue line in the images below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Short columns next to each other |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Long columns next to each other |

##### Mix

Keep the amount of nesting small: Nested rows or columns are valid to a certain degree. It helps to visualize the information structure of your form. However, as mentioned in “Group Hierarchies”, too many sub rows or columns create the impression of a complicated form and reduce the readability.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Less nesting |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  A lot of nested rows and columns |

For Groups with the same hierarchy level, consider putting:

* Group titles at the same height: This can help to identify sections faster
* Groups with a similar amount of content next to each other: This can help to reduce gaps between sections
* Groups with similar / comparable content next to each other

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Groups are aligned |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Groups are not aligned |

##### Responsive Behavior

Currently, A12 allows you to model the layout for a large screen. In case of smaller screens, A12 automatically arranges your content.

For example, inside the Form Model you can divide a Control Grid into up to 12 columns. However, the 12 columns are only applied to a large screen. On a tablet, A12 would transform them to 6 columns, while on a small phone there would only be one column.

*Example for Responsive Behavior of rows in a Control-Grid:*

![Responsive behavior of Grid-Column](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_layout_respBev_example_0001.png)

In conclusion, you cannot completely control the layout of forms via A12 Tools currently. However, there are already plans to provide this feature.

#### UI/UX Pattern

When creating forms, there are some frequently asked questions. Below, you can find tips on how so solve certain issues.
As with all guidelines, these are not strict rules. They can be broken if a use case or requirements demands it.

##### How to improve readability?

###### Terms

Subject specific terms can be used to shorten the amount of text in your application.
However, such terms are limited to a certain group of people. In addition, terms can hold another meaning for different end users. This can result in misunderstandings as different groups think they understand a term correctly which another party uses.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To avoid confusion:  * Use terms that your end users understand * Explain terms if needed * Distinguish terms with various meanings * Use terms in a consistent way |

###### Labels

The needed input of a field is typically described by its label. When done well, you can provide good orientation and guidance for your end users.

A form is much cleaner if you present labels in a consistent way. For example, decide if the labels start with a capitalized letter or not.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  First letter of each label is capitalized |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  First letter of each label is sometimes capitalized and sometimes not |

Short and concise labels are easier to read and understand. Try to limit yourself to single-line labels.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Field with single-line label |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Field with multi-line label |

In some cases, it is not easy or even possible to shorten labels without losing crucial pieces of information. Here are two tips for what you can do in those cases:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * If you have trouble to shorten a label, consider outsourcing redundant parts to a “Group Title” (*see “Information Structure” above*). * If you cannot shorten a label, consider causing intended line breaks to limit the amount of words per line. |

Please note that modeling intended line breaks in labels is currently not possible. You can only try to generate them by reducing layout columns in width.

###### Proximity

Form elements that belong together should be placed close to each other. For example, consider positioning a ZIP code and city Field next to each other or below each other.

![ZIP and City Field are positioned next to each other](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_proximity_example_0001.png)

###### Size of Form Elements

The size of a field provides pieces of information to your end users about how much content they are expected to fill in. A very long field conveys the impression that the end user can or must type much data. A tiny field on the other side creates the impression of limitation.

You can support your end users by resizing fields to an expected input amount. For example, a date field can be short while a description usually requires more space.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Short date Field and large description Field |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Large date Field and short description Field |

However, when adjusting the size of form elements, keep the whole layout in mind.
Sometimes it is better to intentionally reject size adjustments and avoid “ragged alignment” in favor of a cleaner layout.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Many Fields with same width |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Many Fields with different width |

Please note that adjusting the size of Fields via A12’s Modeling Tools is currently limited as explained in “Layouts > Responsive Behavior” above.

###### Recurring Forms and Form Parts

Certain forms are often re-used inside an application. They might vary a bit, but their main elements are the same.

For example, contact forms inside one application may contain fields for name, address, post code and phone number. In case the form shows data of a real person, the name field might be split into forename and last name. In case the form is about a company, there might be a field for the company’s name and department. Both forms may differ a bit, but their overall content is similar.

Try to display such recurring forms in a consistent way. By this, your end users do not have to read and think about each e.g. contact form as they have already encountered similar looking ones.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Contact forms with same appearance |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Contact forms with different appearance |

The same can be applied for recurring parts of a form, too. For example if you decide to put forename and last name next to each other, try to do so in all cases where this combination of fields appears.

##### How to deal with dependencies?

In some cases, form elements are dependent on each other. For example, an end user has stated to be married and therefore needs to fill out additional pieces of information for their partner. But this is of no interest for a non-married end user.

Below, you can find some tips to guide your end users through such dependencies.

###### Visibility

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Only show form elements that are relevant for an end user. * If it is not possible to hide those form elements, display them as disabled. |

###### Proximity

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Keep dependent form elements close by, for example next to or directly below each other. |

##### How to prevent false user inputs?

Sometimes, Fields require a certain input format or a checked checkbox demands the upload of an additional document.

To support a good usability, such issues should be pointed out to end users initially to prevent false user input.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Longitude Field with placeholder text 180°0\"E |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Empty longitude Field |

A12 provides several options to achieve this:

* **Asterisk** after labels of required form elements: “Last Name\*”
* **Placeholder** for input formats: “YYYY-MM-DD”
* **Hint Tooltip** for subject specific explanations of a form element: “The phone number is needed to …​ .”
* **Helper Text** for input requirements: “Year must not be dated back more than 3 years.”
* **Message Box** for notes: “Please attach a copy of the driver’s license.”

Please note, that A12 is currently not supporting to model Helper Texts or Message Boxes.

By initally showing end users what to do, you can:

* Increase a positive user experience as they were able to fill out a form with no problems.
* Reduce the effort of an end user to fill out a form as they do not need to correct mistakes.

##### How to deal with limited space?

The space for a form element might be limited in certain use cases, e.g.:

* On a dashboard
* Inside a repeat

Below, you can find a list of tips for dealing with such situations.

###### Labels

Keep labels readable. Therefore, consider:

* Enlarging the form element to the required label size
* Outsourcing label text to a Group Title, plain text, etc. above the form element
* Using synonyms
* Using common or understandable abbreviations
* Using Tooltips
* Truncated label text with “…​”: Advanced end users can often guess the meaning of truncated words out of the context, but you should use this with care
* Using an suitable icon instead of text

Remember to check all translations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  2 File Uploads: 1st is adjusted in size to make the label easier to read. 2nd uses abbreviation and a tooltip. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  File Upload with long and hard to read label |

Please note that adjusting the size of a File Upload (aka “Attachment” inside A12’s Tools) as shown in the example images above, can currently only be done code-wise.

###### Validation

Generally, error and warning messages should be visible for end users directly. However, when dealing with limited space, A12 offers to outsource such messages to Tooltips.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Field with error tootip |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Field with full error message |

###### Compact Exposition of Data Types

Certain Data Types can be displayed in a compact way. For example:

* “Enumerations” can be displayed as radio buttons or select fields.
* “Strings” can be displayed as a full Text Area or an auto expanding one.

This saves much space, especially in height.

![Select field and radio buttons](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/form_limitedSpace_example_0005.png)

#### Form Elements for Selection

Choosing the right selection widget for form elements might be tricky sometimes, which is why we will try to explain the different advantages and disadvantages of the solutions in this section.

First, you need to decide whether the user can select only one of the given options (= [Single Selection](#_single_selection)) or if multiple options can be selected at the same time (= [Multi Selection](#_multi_selection)). In the next step, you can choose which element fits perfectly to your needs with the help of the tables and use cases below.

If you need a selection element for [Special formats](#_special_formats) such as times, dates or icons, the Picker widget is the best choice.

When modelling selection fields with the A12 tools, you might come across different terminology, which is why we put a short overview in the chapter [Terminology in A12 Tools](#_terminology_in_a12_tools).

---

##### Single Selection

###### Overview

If the user can select only one of the given options, the following elements are possible.
The questions in the table might help to choose the most suitable component:

|  | Checkbox Checkbox | Switch Switch | Radio Buttons Radio Buttons | Select Select | Autocomplete Autocomplete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **How many options** are available? | one | two | a few | many | unlimited |
| Is it an **optional field**, which needs to be resettable? |  | No | ()\* |  |  |
| Do you have **long option names**? |  | No |  |  |  |
| Do you want the user to **directly see and select** the options? |  |  |  | No | No |

\* see section *Yes/No Decisions as optional fields*

If you are still unsure which form element is the best for you, the following use cases and layout recommendations might be helpful to make a decision.

###### Use Cases

**Yes/No Decisions**

For select fields with simple yes/no decisions, we recommend **radio buttons** or the **switch**, as they are

* directly visible and comprehensible
* selectable with one click only.

*Radio buttons with vertical alignment*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Vertical Radio buttons   ---   Use the Radio buttons with vertical alignment if  you want a very good comprehensibility   you need longer option names |

*Radio buttons with horizontal alignment*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Horizontal Radio buttons   ---   Use the Radio buttons with horizontal alignment if:  you have only limited vertical space available |

*Switch*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Switch   ---   Use the Switch if  you have on/off or true/false choices   you have only limited vertical space available   you want a less formal design |

**Yes/No Decisions as optional fields:**

If the select field is an optional field and needs to be resettable to an empty state, then you can use

* Radio Buttons with a third option (e.g. “No information”)
* a Select with a third option (e.g. "No information"), or
* a Checkbox

**Confirmation fields**

For confirmation fields (e.g. “Yes, I agree”), the Checkbox is usually the best choice:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Checkbox confirm   ---   Use the checkbox if:  you want a very good comprehensibility   you need to use longer option names |

**Many available options**

*Select*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Select   ---   Use the Select if:  There are many available options (up to 20 recommended)   The user doesn’t know what terms to search for |

*Autocomplete*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Autocomplete   ---   Use the Autocomplete if:  There is a very high number of available options   The user knows what terms to search for |

###### Layout recommendations

**Complex forms with restricted space**

If the available space is restricted and you have several available options, we recommend Autocomplete or Select:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Use autocomplete or select in a complex form |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Don’t use radio buttons in a complex form |

**Simple forms with sufficient space**

If you have enough space and not so many available options, we recommend using the Radio Buttons:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Use radio buttons in a simple form |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Dont use select or autocomplete in a simple form |

---

##### Multi Selection

If the user can select more than one of the given options, the following components are available.
The questions in the table and the info boxes below might help to choose the most suitable component:

|  | Checkbox Group Checkbox Group | Tag Input Tag Input | Multiselect Multiselect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **How many options** are available? | a few | a few | unlimited |
| Is it an **optional field**, which needs to be resettable? |  |  |  |
| Are the users allowed to **create options themselves**? | No |  |  |
| Do you want the user to **directly see and select** the available options? |  | No | No |

**Checkbox Group**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the Checkbox Group if:  the number of options is not too high   you want a good comprehensibility   you need longer option names |

The checkboxes can be arranged vertically or horizontally, the advantage of the vertical alignment being a better comprehensibility, while the horizontal alignment takes up less vertical space.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Use vertical checkbox group for several options |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Dont use vertical checkbox group for several options |

**Tag Input**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the Tag Input if:  Only a few options will be selected at the same time   The option names are not too long   The user can create options themselves |

**Multiselect**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the Multiselect if:  There is a very high number of available options   The available space is restricted |

---

##### Special Formats

For special data formats we currently offer four types of selection elements:

![Picker types](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/guidelines/forms/picker.png)

In comparison to a simple input, the picker is especially helpful when the available options are restricted (e.g. only dates in the last month are allowed).
In general, the picker is more user friendly, as the users do not have to struggle with the correct date format or the proper names.

---

##### Terminology in A12 Tools

Within the A12 Tools, the terminology for selection fields is sometimes different from the widget showcase:

**Single Selection**

| Date Type | Exposition | Corresponding Widget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enumeration | Compact | Select |
| Autocomplete | Autocomplete |
| Full | Radio basic (with vertical alignment) |
| Inline | Radio basic (with horizontal alignment) |
| Boolean | Switch (with or without value) | Switch |
| Checkbox | Checkbox |
| Confirm | Checkbox | Checkbox |

**Multiselection**

| Date Type | Exposition | Corresponding Widget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-Select | Autocomplete | Multiselect |
| Full | Radio basic (with vertical alignment) |
| Inline | Radio basic (with horizontal alignment) |

## Enterprise UX Pattern

These patterns provide solutions for requirements which mainly occur in enterprise applications.

### Working with Business Objects

![Working with Business Objects](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/working-bo-intro.png)

What does it mean to work with business objects? In our illustration above we pictured our business object as a shopping cart. You might be familiar with the actions which can be performed on a shopping cart, but in enterprise applications these actions can be applied to any professional context. Here are some examples of actions users perform on business objects:

* Overview
* Compare
* Create
* Edit/Update
* Analyze
* Create
* Delete
* Change Status

But as illustrated, actions can’t be seen as stand-alone features and in majority stand-alone actions never can fulfill any requirement. An action often leads to another action or has at least an influence on other business objects. Here is an example to demonstrate this statement:

![Userflow Add to Cart, Overview, Payment](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/wbo-example.png)

As you can see above only the combination of all steps fulfills the whole e-commerce example above. The whole process above is also described as a userflow in UI/UX design. But seldomly a user will process a userflow in a straight forward approach. And thus in order to achieve a good user experience, it is key to also think about the transitions between these actions. We have prepared patterns which takes these transitions into consideration and provide the best user experience for your user’s needs and business requirements. These patterns can all be used and combined simultaneously in an application.

#### Workflow Patterns

##### Master Detail Flow

![Master Detail Illustration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/wbo-md.png)

A master detail pattern is well known in business applications, where the master (left area) is often represented by a table and the detail (right area) by a form for editing or presenting details.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this pattern if  * Users need to quickly switch between different business objects * A business object is not complex but still requires a navigation (max. 2 levels) * Users need to browse the whole object to gather information for carrying out the task |

To achieve this pattern we are providing the Master-Detail layout widget. To get to know the full feature of this layout please take a look here:

[Master Detail Layout](#_master_detail_layout)

If the detail consists of eg. multiple tabs please consider loading the direct tab needed for the task instead of showing the first tab and forcing the user to navigate to the information needed. Alternatively consider using the „Modal Edit“ for certain actions.

##### Modal Edit

![Modal Edit Illustration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/wbo-modal.png)

In this pattern the detail or the necessary information is presented in a modal overlay.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this pattern if  * The business object is not complex and the interface can bring the information directly into the user’s focus * The business object is complex but the task requires only a subset of information to be done |

To achieve this pattern we are using the following components:

[**Widget Showcase → Modal Overlay**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/layout/modal-overlay)

[**Client Sample App**](https://a12-internal-client-master.pidev.mgm-tp.com/index.html#section:UIHandling,feature:ModalRegion) (mgm internal only) → Button "Start nested activity"

[**Client Documentation → Regions**](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_regions)

##### Inline Edit

![Inline Edit Illustration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/wbo-inline.png)

This is an alternative pattern for modal edit. Although patterns can be combined, we strongly advice against mixing this pattern with the modal edit pattern in one view.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this pattern if  * The business object is not complex and the task requires the user to compare his input with other business objects * The information needed to fulfill the task fits in a small area and does not require the user to scroll or extend the area significantly |

This pattern can be achieved with the following table widget:

[**Widget Showcase → Table**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table)

##### New Page

![New Page Illustration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/wbo/wbo-new-page.png)

This pattern opens the detail in a complete new view with its own navigation.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this pattern if  * The content of the business object is complex and requires more than 2 navigation levels * The content is very complex and might require complex patterns like master detail, dashboard etc. to be visualized |

If you want to know how to place the information of the business object or set up the navigation please take a look at these concepts:

[Application Frame](#_application_frame)

[Navigation](#_navigation)

[**Client Documentation → Scene Change**](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_scene_change)

### Validation Handling

Validation is a basic and indispensable concept for every enterprise application. In A12 Plasma we differentiate between two different types of validation handling which have to be accessibile for every user, including blind users and usage without mouse. The types are distinct by the kind of validation and the visual application layer.

* Application Level Validation
* Block Level Validation

  + Form Validation

    - Overall Form
    - Field Specific
  + Table

![Validation Handling Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/validation/validation_intro.png)

#### Validation Principles

If a problem occurs the user must be informed about it - a problem can be an error or a warning and it can appear as a general application problem or as a problem of form validation. If it is based on an input field in a form, this input field is called invalid input. Therefore the following principles have to be followed:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Clear presentation and description of the problem * Design supports the recognizability and distinction of  + errors, as they must be solved   + warnings, as they should be solved |

##### Validation Messages

Validation messages are a crucial part of a validation concept. They should always contain the following information:

* What is the problem?
* Why did it happen?
* How to solve it.

In enterprise applications errors and warnings are often not bound to a single source of failure but in fact could be the result of business logic creating dependencies between multiple sources. In this case provide a list of possible error sources.

To achieve the best user experience also consider the following guidelines:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Be specific to the user’s task. Provide a guidance as concise as possible to solve the problem * Don’t provide generic error messages. Ask yourself: *"How does the error message sound when you speak it in conversation"* |

##### General Design Decisions

Based on the requirements of usability and accessibility guidelines which recommend to use more then one visual characteristic for distinction, our widgets follow common design principles for validation states. These states are expressed in:

**Error**

We use red and and a rectangle with an exclamation mark for displaying errors.

**Warning**

To express warning we use orange and a triangle with an exclamation mark.

#### Application Level Validation

Errors and warnings can also describe problems which are application wide, eg.

* Server connection errors
* Expiring user password warnings

We are providing and recommending the following widgets for displaying these issues:

##### Modal Notification

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this if  The problem needs prompt reaction by the user and without closing the modal there is no other interaction possible with the application - High priority. |

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/feedback/modal-notification)

[**Client Documentation - Error handling**](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_error_handling_in_sagas)

##### Global Message Box

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this if  The problem needs to be shown to the user and it is important to notify the problem application-wide, but the application can still be used - High or medium priority. |

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/feedback/global-message-box)

[**Client Documentation - Error handling**](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_error_handling_in_sagas)

##### Toasts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this if  The user should be informed about the problem but it is not harming the application functionality so the toast can be taken care of or not - Low priority. |

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/feedback/toasts/toast-group)

[**Client Documentation - Notifications**](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_notifications)

#### Block Level Validation

A block level validation describes the validation concept on the level of information blocks eg. an overview or a form.

##### Form Validation

###### Overall Form

The overall form validation checks the data against defined business logic rules. These rules can create dependecies and connections between multiple data fields and should therefore only be validated if the whole form is submitted. This pattern ensures that the user is not disturbed while still fulfilling his task. After the submission of the form we are using a validation bar to display a list of issues. For a live example please visit the link below:

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/business-case/validation-bar#example)

[**Form Engine**](https://a12-internal-form-engine-master.pidev.mgm-tp.com/index.html#formName:computation-validation.errors_and_warnings_and_infos-form) (mgm internal only)

###### Field Validation

The field specific validation is the prompt validation of input data. This should be used for type specific rules, eg. writing a letter into a number field would produce a field specific problem. The problem can be shown to the user immediately and directly on the field. When expecting a certain format, eg. date input, please make use of placeholder texts to indicate which format is expected to avoid user frustration. The field specific error and warning indications are supported by every data entry widget.

The indication can either be shown directly to the user as message or in case you don’t have enough space, we are also providing a tooltip as an indicator:

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-entry/text-field#states)

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-entry/text-field#additional-customizations)

##### Table & Tree Table Validation

For an overall validation of the table you can use the validation bar to offer users a summarized view. Additionally to this we are providing the following solution to display errors and warning in tables and tree-tables. This pattern includes solutions for displaying issues on entry and sub-entry level by differentiating whether the issues is located at the row itself or in a contained row.

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/tree-table/basic#content-type-example)

### Login

![Login Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_intro.png)

In order to keep sensitive data from non-authorized people, logins are a must-have to provide basic websecurity. There are several approaches to logins, e.g. form, certificate or via an external identity provider. As logins are highly connected to the topic of websecurity, please dicuss questions and needs also with your websecurity collegues.

#### Structure

A login usually consists of:

![Application Identifier, Credentials and Login Button](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_structure.png)

**Application Identifier**

To identify an application. This can be done by displaying the application’s name, logo or both.

**Credentials**

Data required for the login, e.g. username and password.

**Login Button**

To submit user inputs to the application.

A12 provides the possibility to adjust a login to your needs. For example, you can use another approach for identification instead of username and password. It is also possible to add more input fields, include captchas or offer a "password forgotten" feature.

![Login Structure Alternatives](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_structure-alternatives.png)

An example login can be found here:

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/business-case/login-layout)

#### Use Cases

When dealing with logins, there are several use cases to consider:

* Successful Login
* Failed Login
* Change Password
* Login via External Identity Provider (IDP)

##### Successful Login

![Successful Login](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_success-log.png)

After a successful login, users are redirected to the starting page of the application. No additional notification is required in general.

However, in case of very sensitive data it is common to inform users about successful logins to improve websecurity, e.g.:

* E-mail about login on different device
* E-mail about login from another country

##### Failed Login

A login can fail for different reasons:

* A user typed in invalid credentials by accident
* The server connection was lost while processing a login
* A hacker tried to inflitrate the application

Users should be informed about failed logins:

* Notification with error message
* Notification about the amount of failed logins
* E-mail about failed logins, e.g. login attempts via another device or a different country

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Use summarizing, vague error messages about credentials like "incorrect user name and/or password" to support websecurity * Provide specific information about suspicious issues, e.g. another device or country |

Based on websecurity guidelines, errors should be shown in a general way and not be bound to a specific field.

![Display Errors](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_errors.png)

##### Change Password

We are differentiating between two use cases where users might want to change their password.

* Inside the application
* Before login

###### Inside the application

Inside the application, "Changing Password" is a user feature. Therefore it should be displayed near other user features like "Logout".

![Change Password inside the application](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_change-p-internal.png)

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/examples/password#change-password)

###### Before login

There are situations in which users desire to set a new password before they have logged in, e.g.:

* A user forgot their password.
* A password expired and a user cannot login.

The common user flow is as follows:

![Change Password Userflow](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_change-pass-userflow.png)

**Request New Password**

An email is sent to the user with further information.

**Receive Link/Token**

The mail consists of information with a link and/or token. Links are utile if a fast
access to the "change password page" is desired. They can be interactive or not. Tokens
are useful if high websecurity is desired. For logins, tokens are most commonly strings,
similiar to serial keys for software. You can also provide both to support users with
different mindsets. For example, there are users who don’t trust links.

**Verification by Link/Token**

A valid link opens a page to change a password. A valid token
needs to be typed in an input field and submitted to achieve the same.

**Change password**

Commonly, the new password requires to be typed in twice. This helps
to confirm an intended password input. Password conditions or tips are often displayed in
this step, too. This supports users when choosing a new password.

[**Widget Showcase**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/examples/password#change-password)

**Redirected to Login**

If the new password is valid, the user can try to log in again.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Provide this feature if users are allowed to change their password themselves * Provide access to this feature on the login page * Provide each step of the userflow in seperated screens to guide the user through the steps |

#### Login with External Identity Provider (IDP)

![Login via IDP](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/login/login_idp.png)

Projects may outsource the user management to a third party sytem. By this, the login itself is not provided by A12 but by another system, a so called external "Identity Provider" (IDP).

We do not have influence on how a login page of an IDP looks like, what kind of input data it requires or which features it supports. However, we recommend embedding the IDP login and providing some information, e.g.

You can login into "Application name" with "IDP name".

The text above is just a simple example for the concept of providing information about the context and purpose to ensure the users that they really log in into their desired application.

### Buttons

![“Cancel” and “save” button](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/button_intro.png)

#### Introduction

Buttons can be used to trigger different functionalities like print and export.
As there are several use cases for buttons, A12 offers you a great variety to choose from. We will take a look at them in the following documentation.

The first part shall help you to find the right button for your specific use case. You will learn about:

* Button types
* Button hierarchy
* How to deal with buttons, that delete data or abort an user flow

The second part introduces UI/UX concepts about how to integrate your button in your application. This part covers how to:

* Position buttons
* Order buttons

#### Button Type

A12 offers to display buttons with:

![Button Types: Text, text and icon, icon only](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/button_type.png)

##### How to use?

When working with buttons, consider the following general usability tips:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use:  * Short and concise button labels. Try to limit yourself to max. 2 words if possible. * Fitting, self-explaining and common icons. * Consistent terms and icons. |

##### When to use?

When choosing a certain button type, keep your use case in mind. Below you can find some tips that shall help you to find the right button for your requirements.

###### Text

Use a Text Button if words describe an action better than an icon alone.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  “Approve” button as text button |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  “Approve” button as icon only button |

###### Text & Icon

You can add an icon to your Text Button to support skim reading.

![“Add” button with additional “plus” icon](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_type_example_0003.png)

###### Icon Only

You should solely use an icon only:

* For commonly known actions, e.g. the "centered text" icon.
* If available space is limited and the usage is clear. Otherwise consider using a context menu.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Icon button for centered text |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Text button for centered text |

#### Button Hierarchy

Sometimes, certain buttons are more often used by end users than others. To highlight their importance, you can define a “hierarchy” for buttons.

Buttons with “text” or “text with icon” can be Primary or Secondary Buttons.

Buttons with “icon only” have an additional third hierarchy level, since they can be repeated/shown in a high number, e.g. as row actions in a table. Therefore, A12 provides a third, less prominent hierarchy level for those “icon only” buttons.

##### When to use?

A12 buttons come with a default hierarchy level. Buttons with “text” or “text with icon” are Secondary Buttons. Buttons with “icon only” uses their third hierarchy level.

If you want to highlight the importance of certain buttons, you can use their higher hierarchy level. This helps your end-user to find those buttons faster.

##### How to use?

###### Primary Button

Primary Buttons are meant to be used for the most important action in a usage context, e.g. “save” in a form screen. Therefore, only one Primary Button should be used in one user flow.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  One Primary and one Secondary Button |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Two Primary Buttons |

###### Secondary Button

A Secondary Button is often used in combination with a Primary Button, e.g. “cancel” when combined with “save”.
While the Primary Button marks the most important action, Secondary Buttons can be used for every other action.
Therefore, they can appear multiple times in one user flow.

![Multiple Secondary Buttons: “Send mail”, “export” and “print”](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_hierarchy_example_0003.png)

---

#### Destructive Buttons

There are use cases in which a button:

* Aborts a user-flow, e.g. cancel a saving process.
* Causes losing data, e.g. delete a document.

Plasma summarizes these behaviors with the term “destructive”.

##### When to use?

You can hint the use cases from above to your end users by displaying the responsible button as a destructive one.

![“Cancel” button (secondary, destructive) next to “save” button (primary)](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_destructive_example_0001.png)

##### How to use?

When working with destructive buttons, keep the following usability tips in mind.

###### Multiple Destructive Buttons

Avoid to use multiple destructive buttons in one user flow. It can be quite confusing for your end user.

For example, take a look a the image below on the right-hand side. There are two destructive buttons. As a result, the user has to think about which buttons causes loosing data and which one does not.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  “Delete” button (destructive) next to “cancel” button (non-destructive) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  “Delete” button (destructive) next to “cancel” button (destructive) |

###### Equal Choices or Actions

In cases of equal actions or choice options, avoid destructive buttons. Else a destructive button looks more important than a non-destructive one.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  “Accept” button (non-destructive) next to “decline” button (non-destructive) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  “Accept” button (non-destructive) next to “decline” button (destructive) |

This can also be applied to Icon Buttons inside the last column of a repeat. As a result, avoid using destructive buttons here as well.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Group of icon only buttons. All are non-destructive. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Groups of icon only buttons. One of them is destructive. |

###### Button Labels

As it is confusing to read the word "black" while it is displayed in white font color, it is also irritating to see a positive label with a color that causes attention. Based on this, avoid using labels like “Yes” for a destructive button. Change the label to fix the problem.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Confirm deleting a file via “delete file” button (destructive). Next to it is a keep file” button (non-destructive). |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Confirm deleting a file via “yes” button (destructive). Next to is is a “no” button (non-destructive). |

###### Accessibility

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Color-blind end users:**  For color-blind end users consider using a “Text with Icon” instead of a “Text” destructive button.  This is not a must-have as the text label also hints the destructive nature of a button. However, it provides the benefit of the regular destructive button for color-blind users, as well. |

![“Delete” button with text and  icon](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_destructive_example_0010.png)

#### Button Position & Order

The right position and order for buttons can improve the usability, consistency and readability of an application. This section summarizes the most important A12 patterns to achieve these goals.

##### General Suggestions

Put buttons that belong together close to each other.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Two buttons next to each other |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Two buttons far apart |

Avoid mixed orders. Instead, order buttons:

* By button type.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Buttons ordered by button type  Buttons ordered by button type |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Button types are mixed |

* By button hierarchy.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Buttons ordered by button hierarchy  Buttons ordered by button hierarchy |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Button hierarchies are mixed |

* Based on being destructive or not.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Buttons ordered by being destructive or not  Buttons ordered by being destructive or not |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Destructive and non-destructive buttons are mixed |

Use a consistent way to:

* Position buttons.
* Order buttons.

##### Action Bar & Footer

The **Action Bar** (aka “Subheading” inside A12 Tools) is located in the top area of the Content Box, while the **Footer** can be found at the very bottom of it. Both wrap the content area of the Content Box, which could contain a large table or a form.

![Action Bar, Content area and Footer](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_actionBar_Footer_example_0000.png)

Overall buttons of e.g. an Overview or a Form Model should be positioned inside the Action Bar or Footer. Common example are “add”, “save” and “cancel”.

![“Add” button in Action Bar. “Cancel” and “save” button in Footer.](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_actionBar_Footer_example_0001.png)

###### When to use?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the Action Bar:  * If end users shall notice a button fast AND * …​if your end users do **not** need to consider the content below the Action Bar before using a button. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the Footer:  * If your end users need to consider the content above the Footer before using a button. |

##### Major and Minor Area

Action Bar and Footer consists of two areas: **Major** and **Minor Area**.
When putting buttons in either the Action Bar or Footer, you also have to choose in which of those areas a button shall be positioned.

![Major and Minor Area in Action Bar and Footer](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_actionBar_Footer_example_0003.png)

###### When to use?

Major and Minor Area differ for Action Bar and Footer due to the western reading direction. When skim reading, end-user will notice buttons inside the Major Areas sooner than the ones in the Minor Area.

The responsive behavior of each area was defined based on the reading direction, too: When the screen gets smaller, buttons inside the Minor Area are collapsed first. After this, buttons in the Major Area get collapsed from the inside to the outside step by step.

Therefore consider the following usability tips:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the **Major Area**:  * For the most important actions, e.g. “save” and “cancel”. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the **Minor Area**:  * For less important actions. |

![Major Area on the left side of Action Bar. Major Area on the right side of Footer.](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_actionBar_Footer_example_0004.png)

###### How to use?

When considering either the Major or Minor Area, also keep the following A12 patterns for Primary Buttons in mind:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Put the Primary Button in the Major Area  * In case of the **Action Bar**, put Primary Button on the very left-hand side. * In case of the **Footer**, put Primary Button on the very right-hand side. |

![Position of Primary Button in Major Area](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/button/btn_actionBar_Footer_example_0005.png)

## Application UX Pattern

These patterns provide solutions for general application requirements.

### Navigation

![Navigation Intro Example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/navigation/nav-intro.png)

#### Navigation Principles

To create a navigation concept it is important to consider the cultural way how information is processed. In the western culture these are the main principles:

![From top to bottom and from left to right](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/navigation/nav-principles.png)

#### Navigation Areas

The main purpose of navigation in enterprise applications is to guide a user through the application in order to find information for fulfilling a task. Based on this we are mainly differentiating conceptually-wise between:

* Structural Navigation
* Task Content

To enable a more fine-grained navigation concept we are extending this concept by providing 4 areas:

* Structural Navigation

  + Main Navigation
  + Sub Navigation
* Task Content

  + Content Navigation
  + Content

![Navigation Areas](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/navigation/nav-areas.png)

##### Main Navigation

The main navigation offers the entry to the major modules of your application. We have chosen a horizontal and unobtrusive space, although it might not be able to show many entries at first sight, due to the following reasons:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Enterprise applications generally don’t have a lot of major modules. The complexity lies within the subsections and connections between the major sections. * Business users usually don’t switch often between the major sections. It’s more common for them to work/start with one major section. Therefore we don’t want the main menu to be prominent on the page. |

##### Sub Navigation

As stated above we can expect a high complexity in a major section. Therefore we have chosen a vertical navigation for representing this due to the following reasons:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Vertical navigations can easily be extended because each entry takes up less space from the whole screen. It is also easier for users to scan the whole navigation when having a big number of entries. * Even if the menu exceeds the displaying area the vertical scroll is the fastest user interaction, so that users can quickly go through the navigation. |

##### Content Navigation

The content navigation and content should mainly be used to present information in order to fulfill a certain task. By reducing/restricting the information to what is really needed you can achieve a good information density and therefore raise the user’s efficiency. Therefore you should:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | * Limit the navigation entries as much as possible. * Keep it simple and the navigation flat, only one information level should be used |

##### Content

To help you structure your content we are providing you the following guidelines and components:

**Plasma documentation**

[Information Structure](#_information_structure)

**Form Engine Documentation**

[Repeats](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_repeats)

[Sections](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_section_state)

**Widget Showcase**

[Collapsible Panel](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/layout/collapsible-panel)

[Heading Styles](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/utils/typography)

#### Layout and Navigation Components

The navigation areas provide a basic navigation structure to deliver a consistent user experience and are realized by using the „Application Frame“ widget, which also provides other layout specifications apart of the navigation. For more information, take a look here:

[Application Frame](#_application_frame)

Each area can consist of various navigation components. Per default we are using the [**Flyout Menu**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/navigation/menu/flyout-menu).

As demonstrated in the widget showcase the menus can represent more than one information level and therefore allow the application to represent more than four information levels. Apart from a possible higher number of levels we are also recommending to group menu entries to achieve a better usability. Due to general usability research this is already recommended if a menu consists of more then 7 entries.

Alternatively to the default navigation components we are also providing the following components to raise the efficiency and usability in certain user scenarios.

##### Accordion

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this widget if  * The user needs to see which entry is selected but doesn’t need to move quickly between the menu entries * The area for navigation is limited and you want to avoid an extra scroll bar, either vertical and horizontal |

[**Accordion**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/navigation/accordion)

##### Tree

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this widget if  * The user needs to see which entry is selected and needs to move quickly between the menu entries * The information structure is very complex and it is necessary for the user to quickly recognize the hierarchy |

[**Tree**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/tree)

##### Sliding Menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use this widget if  * The sub level of a level consists of many entries, which needs to be displayed instantly without any user interaction * The user is focused on one navigation at a time |

[**Sliding Menu**](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/navigation/menu/sliding-menu)

### Notification

![Navigation Areas](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/notification/noti-title.png)

#### Introduction to Notifications

Notifications are messages directed to the user of an application, e.g. "File was saved.". In general, they are meant to inform a user about the state or outcome of their action. In some cases, notifications require user interaction, e.g. confirm or cancel deleting a file.

Notifications are defined by:

* Notification Level
* Notification Type
* Notification Widget

#### Notification Levels

Notification Levels are a conceptual tool defined by Plasma. They can be used to find the most suitable Notification Widget for your use case. Notification Levels are based on the questions:

* What part of your application triggers the notification?
* Where in your application should the notification be visible?

Derived from those questions, Plasma has defined three Notification Levels:

![Navigation Areas](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/notification/noti-levels.png)

##### Application Level

An application-wide notification, e.g. about lost server connection.

##### Block Level

A notification about a part of the application, e.g. a validation summary of a whole form.

##### Element Level

A notification related to a single element, e.g. a validation message of one input field.

#### Notification Types

![Navigation Areas](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/notification/noti-info-success.png)

##### Information

Notification to highlight certain pieces of information.

##### Success

Notification about a successfully finished application process.

![Navigation Areas](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/pattern/notification/noti-warning-error.png)

##### Warning

Notification about a non-critical issue, which can be canceled or ignored by a user.

##### Error

Notification about a critical issue, which needs to be repeated or corrected by a user.

#### Notification Widgets

A12 provides several widgets for notifications. Below you can find them sorted by common usages by Notification Level and Notification Type.

##### Common Usage for Notification Level

| Application Level | Block Level | Element Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * Global Message Box * Modal Overlay * Toast (Permanent) * Toast (Temporary) | * Badge * Modal Overlay * Local Message Box * Toast (Permanent) * Toast (Temporary) * Validation Bar | * Badge * Modal Overlay * Input Message Box * Toast (Connected) * Tooltip |

## Layout Widgets

### Application Frame

![Application Frame Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/app-frame-intro.png)

When analyzing enterprise applications we observed that apart from individual professional requirements, you have recurring features like:

* Global search
* User features eg. Logout
* Navigation
* Content
* Context Navigation & Actions

To deliver a consistent user experience and to help you get started, our application frame provides layout specifications for placing these features.

#### Main Area

![Main Area](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/main-area.png)

##### Application Header

The application header is intended to be used for global application-wide functionalities and typically consists of the following features:

![Logo, Application Name, User information, logout](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/app-header.png)

The header is not restricted to the shown features but in fact provides four slots which can be used for placing information or functionalities. In case you want to place more then four features we recommend grouping these functionalities to keep the number of options at four. This is especially important for mobile applications considering the recommended touch size for guaranteeing the best usability.

##### Navigation Area

This area is preserved for the main navigation of the application. For a complete view on our navigation concept take a look here:

[Navigation](#_navigation)

#### Sub Area & Content

Visually the sub area and the content are separated, but from a conceptual and professional view these areas are strongly connected to each other. In our concept we consider both areas combined as the whole view of a complex business object or a module with multiple screens. Each application can consist of several of these views. To demonstrate this concept we have illustrated some views of outlook using the described combination.

![Sub Area of Email, Calendar and Contacts](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/sub-area-content.png)

##### Sub Area

This area is optional and can consist of multiple functionalities:

![Sub Area with context information, sub navigation and actions](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/sub-area.png)

##### Content

Depending on the actual content and the user scenario it is required to display the data in different ways. Therefore the content area can consists of multiple layouts, e.g.:

![Application Header](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/app-frame/content.png)

These examples only show possible layouts. For further information and layout options, please take a look here:

### Master Detail Layout

![Master Detail Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_intro.png)

The Master Detail Layout is a specific UI solution to enable users getting an overview and working with a large set of business objects. Additionally to the master detail we are also providing other UI solutions which are documented here:

[Working with Business Objects](#_working_with_business_objects)

#### Usage

Our Master detail layout provides slots which can consists of various components. The most common usage of the master detail consists of a table representing the master and a detail represented by a form. But there are also further usages possible.

![Master Detail Usage](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_usage.png)

#### Layout

##### Slot Number

Typically a master detail consist of only 2 slots as shown above, but in enterprise applications information structure can be very complex, therefore our master detail allows not only 2 levels but provides the possibility to use as much slots as needed. Depending on your screen resolution and use case you can define how many slots are visible at the same time.

![Master Detail Slot Number](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_slot-number.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We recommend to use a maximum of 4 slots. In case you have a deeper information structure, we recommend to use our navigation concept:  [Navigation](#_navigation) |

##### Slot Size

Depending on the use case and your content it is necessary to define a certain size for a slot. To guarantee a harmonious user experience, our layout widgets uses a 12-column grid system, therefore you can set the slot width from 1-12 columns eg.:

![Master Detail Slot Size](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_slot-size.png)

The size definition is only valid for desktop devices and tablets. On the smartphone each slot will use the full width of the device.

#### Navigating Between Slots

As described above, the layout itself only provides layout slots. However, it is still necessary to consider the following navigation concept to guarantee a consistent user interaction. Our concept provides solutions for the following use cases:

* Opening the next slot
* Closing a slot
* Going to a certain slot

##### Opening the next slot

To open the next slot, any interactive element in the current slot can serve as a trigger, e.g. a table row or a certain row action. This is strongly based on your requirement.

![Master Detail Open Slot](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_slot-open.png)

##### Closing a slot

Our design system recommends to use the following interactions for closing a slot.

![Close Slot with arrow back or close x](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/layout-widgets/master-detail/md_slot-close.png)

**Back**

This solution should be used if there is only one slot visible at a time.

**Close**

The "Close" pattern should be used if there are 2 or more slots visible at a time.

##### Going to a certain slot

In case you are using more then 2 slots, it might be necessary for users to quickly go back to a certain slot. For this use case, Plasma provides the interaction pattern using a select enabling the quick return to e.g. slot 1.

## Widgets

### Table

![Table Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/widgets/table/table_intro.png)

#### Usage

Tables are used to display Business Objects in an ordered structure to help users get a quick overview.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Use the table if:  * The business objects have many properties * You need a full overview over the business object properties * Users need to quickly scan all the data entries |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t use the table if:  * The data only consists of a smaller set of properties (<6). To display these objects we recommend using Cards for a better user focus * The data is image-heavy. For this purpose we recommend using the Gallery. |

#### Use Cases

Tables are often used as part of common enterprise UX patterns, e.g:

![Table use case example with Overview and Edit](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/assets/widgets/table/table-use-case.png)

We provide different UI solutions and approaches for the shown user flow above. For further information please take a look here:
