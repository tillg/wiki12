# Accessibility

## Introduction to Accessibility

Accessibility (or short **A11Y**) is the concept of making a product or service accessible to everyone - including people with disabilities or special needs.

For web accessibility, this means that people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations, are able to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the web. This includes both "direct access" (without assistance) and "indirect access" (with the help of assistive technology such as screen readers).

### Accessibility in A12 Projects

If an A12 project wants to be accessible, it doesn’t need to develop every accessibility function from scratch. Many of those functionalities are already provided by A12 and are working out-of-the-box. However, there is still a wide spectrum of application-specific requirements which cannot be delivered by A12 and have to be done by the project itself.

With this documentation, we want to support the projects and their members by giving detailed information on A11Y requirements and on how to meet them. These requirements not only concern all working areas (design, modeling, development and testing), but also all levels of the application (from application frame to single content element).

**How accessibility is reflected in the working process of a project**

A short overview of some of the most important A11Y requirements is given below. For more detailed and specific information, please consult the sections [Basics](#_basics), [Modeling](#_modeling), [Developing](#_developing) and [Quality Assurance](#_quality_assurance).

Creating an accessible project starts with some **basics**, since many functionalities for accessibility have to be defined individually for the project before they can be modeled or developed and others have to be kept in mind throughout the whole working process.

The next step towards an accessible project is the **design**, as

* a consistent structure of the application and its elements
* a responsive behaviour of the components, as well as
* accessible color and contrast themes

are fundamental requirements for accessibility.

On the **modeling** side, there are requirements such as

* alternative texts for images
* meaningful labels for input fields and
* marking mandatory fields.

The most extensive part of the work towards an accessible project is of course to be done in the **development** process. On a global level, there are requirements such as

* document titles
* multiple means of navigation
* focus behaviour
* heading hierarchy
* correct syntax.

But also on a very granular level, every component needs to be given the necessary semantic information (e.g. by setting the required properties), so it can be used with keyboard and correctly interpreted by screen readers.

Last of all, accessibility requirements also need to be integrated in the **quality assurance** process to make certain that all components are interacting in such a way that the whole application and every part of it is accessible. Especially before Go-Live a thorough accessibility test is necessary as a reference for the [Accessibility Statement](#_accessibility_statement).

### Why Accessibility is Important

#### Target Groups and their Requirements

In order to have a better understanding of accessibility and the resulting requirements, it is helpful to bring to mind the different impairments that might affect the users of applications. For our purposes, these can be roughly summarized in the following groups:

![Blind or otherwise visually impaired users. Deaf or hard-of-hearing people. Users with cognitive or motor deficits including limited movement. Older users. Users with different or older technology. Users with temporal or situational disabilities](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/accessibility/assets/target_groups.png)

![Pfeil](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/accessibility/assets/arrow1.png)

![Usage with keyboard only. Reading by screen readers. Good contrasts. Zooming without loss of function or content](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/accessibility/assets/Main_Accessibility_Requirements.png)

#### The Four Principles of Web Accessibility

The international accessibility standards are grouped into 4 basic principles, which represent the different needs of the users:

Perceivable

* Text alternatives for non-text content (e.g. graphics)
* Alternatives for multimedia and animations
* Clearly structured content
* High color contrasts
* Information not only conveyed by color differences

Operable

* Keyboard Accessible
* No time restrictions
* No blinking or flashing content, animations can be disabled
* Easy navigation and orientation
* Different input modalities possible (e.g. voice recognition)

Understandable

* Readable and understandable text
* Predictable user interfaces
* Assistance to avoid and correct mistakes

Robust

* Compatibility with different user tools (browsers, devices, assistive technologies, …​)
* Clean and valid HTML code
* Programmatically determinable content (interactive elements, status messages)

#### Standards and Regulations

The most important international standard for web accessibility are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (**WCAG**) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). They are a set of recommendations for making web content more accessible and can be found here: [WCAG 2.2.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)

In the EU, the **Web Accessibility Directive** (EU) 2016/2102 determines that all public web sites and apps in the EU have to be accessible by making them ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’. It requires:

* an accessibility statement for each public website and mobile app
* a feedback mechanism so that users can flag accessibility problems or request access to inaccessible content
* regular monitoring of public sector websites and apps by Member States.

The harmonized European standard for accessibility is set out in the [**EN 301 549**](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) (especially chapter 9 for websites) and is based on the WCAG.

In Germany, web accessibility is standardized by the [**BITV 2.0**](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/BJNR184300011.html) (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung), whose regulations are also based on the WCAG.
It requires that websites and applications shall

* comply with harmonized standards or parts of these standards
* provide an accessibility statement
* provide explanations in German Sign Language and Easy Language

One evaluation procedure based on the BITV 2.0 and EN 301 549 is the BIK BITV-Test, which includes 98 comprehensive [test steps](https://webtest.bitv-test.de/index.php?a=dl&t=s) (*only available in German*).

When developing accessible web applications, mgm A12 uses the criteria of the WCAG and the BIK BITV-Test.

## Basics

As we said above, many application-specific requirements for accessibility cannot be delivered by A12 and have to be done by the project itself. Most of them are explained in detail in the respective chapters Design, Modeling, Development and Testing.

However, in this chapter you will find a couple of features for accessibility which

* have to be defined at a general level for the whole application
* are important throughout the whole working process
* are not relevant for every project
* are fulfilled when using the A12 package but should be checked in the project

### General definitions needed

The following features have to be defined in general for the whole application, preferably in the concept stage, so that they can be modeled or implemented in a correct and consistent way later on:

| Requirement | Description | Technical Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Document titles** | Every web page / view should have an accurate and descriptive title. We recommend the following structure for all document titles:  [ *Name of current page* ] - [ *Name of web application* ]  Hints for defining document titles:  * The definition of "view" should be done in the project.  + Example: In a master detail concept the master view needs an individual document title, but for detail view it is unnecessary. * The name of the current page can be the following (depending on the structure of the application):  + the selected main menu entry   + the selected sub menu entry or   + the main headline. * The title should be unique, precise and not too long * Decorative elements (e.g. ~~, ===) should be avoided | The specification of how the document title should be set needs to be done by the project itself. The implemenation should be done by the developers → an example can be seen in the [Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/) |
| **Link text format** | Links to a file should inform about file type and size within the link text to meet the user expectations when opening / downloading the file. Example link text: "Rules (PDF, 2MB)". | Static link texts for files should be given to the modeler / developer. |

### Ever-present requirements

The following general requirements have to be kept in mind throughout the whole modeling and developing process:

| Requirement | Description | Technical Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alternative texts for non-text content** | Every information that is provided visually, must be accessible for visually impaired users as well. This means above all that every non-text content of an app must have a text alternative that clarifies its purpose. For example, information-bearing graphics as well as icons and icon buttons must have tooltips/title attributes which describe their function. Also, information like when an input field is mandatory should not be given only by a visual highlight. | * Modeling: see the tables in the chapter [Modeling](#_modeling) for Icons, Inputs with mandatory fields and other * Developing: see the description in [General Widgets](#_general_widgets) |
| **Labels for inputs** | Relations between different elements that belong together should be clear to the user, for example input fields shall have a label, so that the user knows what kind of input one is dealing with. | * Modeling: see the table in the chapter [Form Model](#_form_model) for Inputs * Developing: see the description in [Widgets for Data Entry](#_widgets_for_data_entry) |
| **Focus** | For keyboard handling it is essential to have a well-functioning focus behaviour so that the users have access to all functionalities and that they always know where they are.  This means that:  * Every interactive element should receive the focus by tab key * Every element that gets the focus by tab key has a clearly visible focus design * The focusable components receive focus in a conclusive and understandable order (especially when content is created dynamically) | See chapter [Focus](#_focus) for more detailed information. |

### Optional application-specific features

The following three requirements are not relevant for every project, so please check if they are important for your application:

| Requirement | Description | Technical Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Localization** | If a project is using different languages than English, then these languages need localized texts. The same goes of course for hidden texts, which are necessary for screen reader users. For German hidden texts, most localizations are already available for the widgets:  Expand to see localized texts in the widgets | Widget | English Text | German Text | | --- | --- | --- | | **Accordion** | "Open" / "Close" | "Aufklappen" / "Zuklappen" | | **Autocomplete & Multiselect** | "Clear text" | "Eingabe löschen" | | **Badge - Basic** | "Info notifications"  "Warning notifications"  "Error notifications"  "Success notifications" | "Infomeldungen"  "Warnmeldungen"  "Fehlermeldungen"  "Erfolgsmeldungen" | | **Badge - Tiny** | "Info notifications available"  "Warning notifications available"  "Error notifications available"  "Success notifications available" | "Infomeldungen verfügbar"  "Warnmeldungen verfügbar"  "Fehlermeldungen verfügbar"  "Erfolgsmeldungen verfügbar" | | **Breadcrumb** | "Breadcrumb" | "Pfadangaben" | | **Collapsible panel** | "Open" / "Close" | "Aufklappen" / "Zuklappen" | | **Counter** | "2 Entries" | "2 Einträge" | | **External Link** | "Leave Page" | "Verlassen der Seite" | | **File Upload** | "Cancel upload" | "Upload abbrechen" | | **Filter (used in Filter Bar)** | "Filter name"  "Selected option"  "Delete" | "Filter Name"  "Gewählte Option"  "Löschen" | | **Filter Bar** | "Filter bar"  "Show less filters"  "Show more filters" | "Aktive Filter"  "Weniger Filer anzeigen"  "Mehr Filter anzeigen" | | **Filter Selector** | "Filter container"  "Filter option container" | "Fiter container"  "Filter Optionen" | | **(Global) Message Box** | "Information: "  "Success: "  "Warning: "  "Error: " | "Information: "  "Erfolg: "  "Warnung: "  "Fehler: " | | **Menu** | "Further menuitems"  "Open submenu"  *Mobile only:* "Inactive:"  "Chosen level:"  "You are here:"  "Current page: " | "Weitere Menüpunkte"  "Untermenü öffnen"  *Mobile only:* "Inaktiv:"  "Gewählte Ebene:"  "Sie befinden sich hier:"  "Aktuelle Seite:" | | **Menu - Pop-up** | "Open menu"  "Close menu" | "Menü öffnen"  "Menü schließen" | | **Menu - Pop-up Header Trigger** | "Selected" | "Gewählt" | | **Multiselect Checkbox** | "De/Select all" | "Alle auswählen / abwählen" | | **Pagination** | "First page"  "Previous page"  "Next page"  "Last page" | "Erste Seite"  "Vorherige Seite"  "Nächste Seite"  "Letzte Seite" | | **Plugin Editor** | "Bold"  "Italic"  "Underline"  "Bullet list"  "Numbered list"  "Decrease indent"  "Increase indent"  "Text alignment"  "Left"  "Centered"  "Right"  "Justified" | "Fett"  "Kursiv"  "Unterstrichen"  "Aufzählung"  "Nummerierte Liste"  "Einzug verkleinern"  "Einzug vergrößern"  "Textausrichtung"  "Linksbündig"  "Zentriert"  "Rechtsbündig"  "Blocksatz" | | **Table** | "sortable"  *Mobile only:* "sorted ascending" / "sorted descending" | "sortierbar"  *Mobile only:* "aufsteigend sortiert" / "absteigend sortiert" | | **Tag - removable tag** | "Remove tag" | "Schlagwort löschen" | | **Tag - tag group** | "Tags" | "Schlagworte" | | **Time Picker** | "Select a time" | "Wählen Sie eine Uhrzeit" | | **Toast** | "Close" | "Schließen" | | **Tooltip** | "Press Escape to close tooltip" | "Tooltip schließen mit Escape" | | **Tree** | "Collapse subitems"  "Expand subitems" | "Unterpunkte zuklappen"  "Unterpunkte aufklappen" | | **Tree - Insertable** | "Insert top"  "Insert below"  "Insert as child" | "Oben einfügen"  "Darunter einfügen"  "Als Kindelement einfügen" | | **Typography** | "Expand" / "Collapse" | "Aufklappen" / "Zuklappen" | | **Validation Bar with Pagination** | "Error:" / "Warning:" (desktop only)  "Errors, double tap to show list" (mobile only, same for warnings)  "Open validation menu" (for pop up menu)  "Previous issue"/ "Next issue" (for pagination) | Fehler:" / "Warnung:" (desktop only)  "Fehler, Doppeltippen für Übersicht" (mobile only, same for warnings)  "Validierungsmenü öffnen" (for pop up menu)  "Vorheriges Problem" / "Nächstes Problem" (for pagination) | | **Wizard** | "Previous"  "Next" | "Zurück"  "Weiter" | | In order to enable localizations for non-English languages, the language provider is needed → see the description in [Developing](#_developing). |
| **Time Limit** | If an application needs to have a time limit, then the time counter must be stoppable or extendable.  However, we recommend to not have a time limit, as some users need more time to read the content or to fill in data. | The time limit process needs to be implemented by the project itself. |
| **Keyboard documentation** | If the application implements special and unusual keyboard shortcuts, this should be communicated to the user, for example as an accessible document (like PDF) or as an accessible part / web page of the application. | The documentation must be generated (written) and presented to the user (implemented in the application) by the project itself. |
| **Alternate Access** | A project with more than two or three web pages / views, which are not linked sequentially, should provide at least 2 different ways to locate a web page within a set of web pages, for example:  * Menu (main menu in header and sub menu as sidebar are counted as one) * Search * Sitemap * (Breadcrumb is not counted as an autonomous way)  Background information: With more than one way to navigate pages or views of a web application, people are able to find information faster. Users with screen magnifiers or screen readers may find it easier to navigate by using a search, rather than scrolling through a large navigation bar. A person with cognitive disabilities may prefer a table of contents or site map. | Needs to be done via modeling or developing by the project itself. |

### Requirements fulfilled by the A12 package

There are a few general requirements which are fulfilled when using the A12 package. Nevertheless they should be checked in the projects:

| Function | Requirement | Motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mobile use** | The content and functionality of an application should be available without limitations because of the screen orientation (landscape and portrait mode) or screen size of the user’s device.  For path-based and motion-based operations (like swiping or shaking the phone) there shall exist an accessible alternative.  Every interactive element / function shall be possible to abort (not triggered by down-event).  → *Is provided by A12 within the responsive design* | There is a wide-ranging multitude of mobile devices and viewports that should be covered to the best possible extent. Also there are users who are limited to a certain screen orientation or who are not able to use the touch as precisely as others. |
| **Mouse and Keyboard** | All functions and interactions shall be equally usable with mouse and keyboard only. Every interactive element should be focusable by using the tab key. This focus and also the mouseover effect on interactive elements should be clearly visible.  → *A12 strives to fulfill mouse and keyboard functionality for all widgets and features* | Users who can’t use the mouse should be equally able to access the app with a keyboard. |
| **Structure of application** | The application should be structured into two or three main parts:  * Header with `role=banner` * Main content area with `role=main` * Footer (if existing) with `role=contentinfo`  If the application contains forms, the `role=form` should be used.  Each of these roles should only be used once per view.  → *Is provided by A12* | This helps users to better understand the overall organization of the application. People who are blind will be able to jump the focus from role to role with keyboard navigation.  Forms need `role=form` for semantic meaning and better screenreader use. |
| **Structure - Heading Hierarchy** | A web page / view of a web application should be well structured and organized into sections with headings. These headings must have a correct hierarchy (h1, h2, h3 …​). The level of the headings is automatically set by the Form Engine, but it should be re-checked after project deployment. For some widgets it must be set manually.  → *Is generally provided by A12 but should be checked by the project* | This helps the users to understand the overall organization of the page content more easily. People who are blind will know when they have moved from one section to another and will be able to jump the focus from heading to heading with keyboard navigation. |
| **Syntax** | The HTML syntax of a web application must be valid, meaning that it should not include any structural mistakes such as missing start or end tags or duplicate IDs. If the used HTML-code is correct can be checked at <https://validator.w3.org/>.  → *The A12 widgets pass an automated syntax check, but a project should have a final syntax check by itself*  This requirement was removed in the new WCAG 2.2, but the European regulation EN 301 549, which is legally binding for public authorities, is still based on WCAG 2.1 and will not be updated anytime soon. | A clean code makes it easier for browsers and screen readers to interpret correctly a web application. |
| **Zoomed application** | The web application should not lose content or functionality when the browser is resized up to 200 percent.  → *Is provided by A12 with a viewport based responsive design* | People with a reduced vision should be able to zoom in on the page / view and still have all information accessible. |

### Accessibility Statement

The German regulation BITV (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung) requires that all websites hosted by public sector bodies must provide an accessibility statement on their website which:

* shall be published in an accessible format and shall be accessible from the homepage and from every page of a website
* shall contain comprehensive, detailed and clearly understandable information on the compatibility of the website with the accessibility requirements under sections 3 and 4 of the BITV
* shall be based on an assessment of the compliance of the website with the requirements specified in § 3 BITV, which can be carried out by a third party or the public body itself
* shall offer contact information so that users can give feedback
* shall be updated annually and whenever significant changes are made to the website

#### Template

We recommend to provide a static page (usually located in the footer) for which you might use the text of the following template:

These templates can be adapted to your project with regard to possible support descriptions for special implemented functionalities (e.g. keyboard shortcuts).

## Design

The visual styling of a website is a very important element of accessibility as it helps to support people with color blindness, low vision and limited motor abilities. Besides, it is also relevant for people using the High Contrast Mode in Windows and user defined browser styles.

These are the core accessibility requirements for design that should always be fulfilled:

### Color

The content of a page must be entirely perceivable **without the need of colors**. In addition, there shall be **no referring to color or other sensory characteristics such as shape, size or visual location**.

Therefore colors must not be used as the only distinguishing feature to:

* convey information (e.g. a form that uses colors to indicate required fields)
* indicate an action
* prompt a response
* highlight a visual element

This doesn’t mean that colors should not be used on a page, but that **structural distinguishing features** should be added as well.

Examples for such supplementary features are:

* Icons or symbols
* Additional text
* Contour Style (e.g. solid, dotted, hard contour or soft/blurred contour)
* Contour Size (e.g. border, outline, box-shadow)
* Font Styles (bold, semi-bold, italic, underline, etc.)
* (Background-)Pattern
* Shape
* Adding a colored background, e.g. in case there is none in a default state of a component, but one when hovering (this changes the shape).
* Other non-color attributes: E.g. an additional arrow shaped marker

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Distinction by color and icons |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Distinction only by color |

**Color Check Tools**

Tools for testing a website by simulating color blindness are:

* the Windows setting "Color filters" (Start > Settings > Ease of Access)
* the Firefox AddOn ["Let’s get color blind"](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/let-s-get-color-blind/)

### Contrast

The visual presentation of texts, graphics and interactive elements should fulfill a minimum contrast ratio between background color and foreground color.

The minimal **contrast ratio of 4.5:1** is required for:

* Text or images of text with a font size <24 px (or <18,7 px for bold text), including placeholders

The minimal **contrast ratio of 3:1** is required for:

* Large-scale text or images of text with a font size of at least 24 px
* Interactive components without text, such as

  + Icons of icon buttons
  + Background color or border of inputs
  + Background color or border of elements without text
  + Check mark of checkboxes
* All different states of interactive components without text, such as

  + Icons of selected or activated icon buttons
* Other elements which are required to understand content, e.g. icons without explaining text

**No contrast ratio** is required for:

* Inactive elements, except they provide information which is needed to understand the context, etc.
* Decorative elements, e.g.

  + Borders, in case the contrast ratio of the element’s background-color fulfills contrast of 3:1
* Text, which is

  + part of an inactive element
  + purely decorative
  + part of a logo or brand name
  + part of an image with significant other visual content
  + is not visible to anyone

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Good contrasts |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Contrast not good enough |

**Contrast Check Tools**

The contrast ratio of two colors can be checked with the help of the following tools:

* Software (recommended): [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser)
* Online contrast checkers, e.g.

  + <https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/>
  + <https://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/>
  + <http://colorsafe.co/>
* Browser AddOns, e.g. [WCAG Contrast Checker](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/wcag-contrast-checker/)

### Consistency

Components that have the same functionality or semantical meaning should be identified consistently, for example the same icons should always be used for the same function.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do:  Consistent icons |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Don’t:  Same icons for different meanings |

### Other General Requirements

The following points are also requirements of BITV and WCAG that should be kept in mind in the process of design specifications:

* **Resizeable** **Text**: User should be able to zoom up to 200%. Therefore avoid designs which might result in issues like cutting off text.
* **Text as Graphics**: Important texts such as headlines, list entries or buttons must not be bitmap images (e.g. jpg, png, gif). This is because users cannot adjust bitmap images in size and color according to their needs.
* **Reflows**: Content and functions should adjust for a width of 320px (e.g. small devices) or when zooming, so that the need of scrolling both vertically and horizontal can be avoided.
* **Text Spacing**: Text spacing needs to be adjustable for users. Therefore avoid specs, which might result in issues like cutting off text.
* **Flashing/blinking**: Animations in which content flashes up more than 3 times within 1 second should be avoided, as they are problematic for users with e.g. epilepsy.

### Interactive Elements

Interactive Elements such as buttons or links can have different states which need to be perceivable by every user. There are the following requirements:

* **Interactive Elements** should be recognizable as interactive
* **Readonly and Disabled:**

  + should be recognizable as inactive
  + they can have the same design, but readonly texts that are necessary for orientation/operation must fulfill a contrast ratio of 4,5:1
* For **state changes and different states** a contrast ratio of 3:1 is required, when the difference is only made by color
* **Hover and Focus:**

  + The focus shall always be visible
  + Hover and focus can have the same design and must fulfill the contrast ratio of 3:1 (element:background)
* **Checked:** The state "checked" should have a structural distinguishing feature (e.g. a check mark for checkboxes, a bullet for radio buttons)
* **Links** need a structural distinguishing feature (e.g. an underline)
* The pseudo-class :active is not recommended, since it can be confusing when the style of an element is changing when you click on it

## Modeling

For application-wide general requirements, please consult the chapter [Basics](#_basics). For specific requirements within the modeling tools, see the following chapters:

### General Requirements

| **Feature** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content box header** | For every content box (= overall frame for the content area), there is a header which can have a label. This label should always be set as visible.  It is not recommended to have an empty label, because this would lead to syntax and semantic problems.  Technical background: The label always has `role=heading` and an `aria-level` for correct semantic. An empty label induces an empty div-container with `role=heading` and an `aria-level`.  *Example in Form Engine:* Form Engine Content Box Header |
| **Confirmation texts** | The confirmation dialogue should always have the label and the title. |
| **Graphics and Icons** | All information-bearing graphics and icons (non-interactive) must have tooltips which describe their function. This is set by the label with the option "Hide Label" activated, which sets the `title` attribute in the HTML-code.  *Example in Form Engine:* Title Localization in Form Model |
| **Icon Buttons**  (e.g. Row Actions, buttons in subheader and footer, …​) | If a button has only an icon and no label, then a title must be set for the button which describes its function (e.g. "Delete" for destructive button).  Icon Button with tooltip |

### Form Model

#### Requirements for Inputs

| **Feature** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Labels** | All inputs shall have a label. If a visible label is not wanted by design, then a hidden label should be used by setting the label and activating the checkbox "Hide Label". |
| **Mandatory fields** | If a field is mandatory (can be set in the Data Model), this information needs to be given to the user by the label (e.g. asterisk) and by an explanation above the form.  * When mandatory fields are marked: The sentence above the form informs the user that the named mark is used for mandatory fields. * When mandatory fields are not visibly marked: The sentence above the form informs the user that ALL fields are mandatory.  Example of mandatory info |

#### Requirements for Repeats

| **Feature** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Icon Buttons for Row actions** | All interactive icon buttons shall have tooltips (`title` attribute) which describe their function.  The five standard icon buttons in repeats already have default texts ("Edit"/"Bearbeiten", "Delete"/"Löschen", "Copy"/"Kopieren", "Up" and "Down"/"Nach oben" and "Nach unten").  If you want to change the text of a repeat icon button, you can do it:  * for all buttons of one view which have the same function: Settings → Repeat Default Button Labels  Setting the icon button title for all repeats  * just for the icon buttons for a particular repeat:  Setting the icon button title for one repeat |
| **Interactive Rows** | The interactive rows for repeats shall have tooltips (`title` attribute) which describe their function. The text for the default row action Edit/View is automatically the same as the text for the edit button. It is set as "Edit"/"Bearbeiten" per default, but can be changed as described above for icon buttons.  Setting the title for Edit button and Row Action |
| **Columns resize** | This option is not recommended, as it might result in unnecessary horizontal scrolling with e.g. browser zoom. |
| **Column settings** | Fixed width:  It is not recommended to set a fixed width, as it might result in unnecessary horizontal scrolling with e.g. browser zoom.  Pin direction:  Not recommended, because with browser zoom or on smaller viewports important columns might be hidden (see example [Overview Model](#_overview_model)) |
| **Multiple repeats in one view** | If the view contains more than one table, then every table needs an individual hidden label (aria-label). This is done by setting a label for the repeat and selecting the option "Hide title". |
| **Infinite Scrolling** | It is **not** possible for now to have an accessible table with infinite scrolling because of the use of a third product library. |

#### Specific Feature Requirements

| Feature | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Annotation** | If there is an element used in annotations which affects the frontend (HTML-code) or layout of a view, then the output should be checked for accessibility before going online. |
| **Attachment** (File Upload) | * Set label (otherwise there would be an input without label causing A11Y-issue) * Also, when used in repeats the label will be displayed as column header → option "Hide Label" can be used:  + without icon: will set the label as hidden text in column header   + with icon: will set the label as `title` attribute and hidden text for the icon in column header |
| **Dependencies** | Modelers have to ensure, that dependencies follow the "reading order" → the master field must be located (somewhere) in front of the changing content. The field label or value of a master field should be self-explaining to understand the dependency.  This is also true for dependent required fields. |
| **Dynamic Subtitles** | We don’t recommend using content box subtitles which are added dynamically after the user entered data, because users with visual impairments might not notice the change. |
| **Expressions / Text** | Beware of using HTML-code here, like <h1>, <img>, etc. as there are certain things to keep in mind for accessibility. Tags like <font> are usually ok. In case of uncertainty, ask an accessibility expert for advice. Examples of known issues:  * heading hierarchy, * `title` attribute for links leaving the page, * `title` attribute for e-mail links (set as “(mailto:address@example.com 'E-Mail title')”), * HTML-syntax if <br>-tags are generated, * mandatory label if used in repeats and * mandatory `alt` attribute for images.  The generated HTML-code should always be checked for accessibility before going online. |
| **Switch** (Boolean) | If there is no visible label, there shall be a hidden label (set label and activate the checkbox "Hide Label"). |

### Overview Model

#### Overview Tab

| Section | | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Columns** | Label | The label for the column headers must always be set (usually it’s already set in the Document Model).  If you only want to display an icon without text, then you have to activate the checkbox “Hide Label”. |
| Pin Direction | Please be careful with using Pin Directions for columns, as this might lead to problems on smaller views or mobile devices.  You should only pin columns that are the most important and that are rather slim.  Also, you should always check whether your table is still usable on smaller viewports and doesn’t have the problems shown in the example below.  *Table with pinned columns on desktop view:*  Table with pinned columns on desktop  *Same table with pinned columns on mobile view:*  Table with pinned columns on mobile  In the example, you can see that the pinning results in the following problems:  * The first column is not sufficient for the identification of the entry * The pinned columns take the entire available space so that  + the action column is not visible anymore and   + the other not-pinned columns are not reachable |
| Width | It is not recommended to set a fixed width, as it might result in unnecessary horizontal scrolling with e.g. browser zoom |
| **Columns Resize** | | The checkbox “Enable Columns Resize” should not be selected, because when it is checked, the columns get a fixed width and the responsive features of the columns are disabled. |

#### Custom Actions Tab

| **Section** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Row Action** | Set either a label or an icon and a title. |
| **Context Menu** | The buttons of the context menu always need a label. |
| **Subheader + Footer** | Minor + Major Buttons. Set either a label or an icon and a title. |
| **Title for Interactive Rows** | Interactive rows should have a title, so that the user gets an information about the row action on mouse-over on the row. |

#### Model Settings Tab

| **Section** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Labels** | The label must be set so that the main container box has a heading. An empty label leads to syntax and semantic problems. It is possible to hide the heading with the checkbox "Hide Label", but it is not recommended to not have a visible heading.  *Example in Overview Engine Showcase:* Content box header in the Overview Engine |

#### Non-interactive overview tables

If the overview table is not supposed to be interactive, meaning that no action is triggered by clicking on a row, then this needs to be set in the code.

The non-interactive overview can be created by implementing a custom overview component based on the client provided ViewViews.OverviewEngineView component, in which the onDocumentClick callback is not defined.

An example of the implementation can be seen in the [Overview Engine](https://a12-internal-overview-engine-master.pidev.mgm-tp.com/app/#showcase:product,feature:pagination) (mgm internal only).

![non-interactive overview example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/accessibility/assets/non_interactive_overview.png)

### Tree Model

#### Tree Tab

| **Section** | | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Columns** | Label | The label for the column headers must always be set (usually it’s already set in the Document Model).  If you only want to display an icon without text, then you have to activate the checkbox “Hide Label”. |
| **Node Types** | Row Actions | Interactive rows should have a title, so that the user gets an information about the row action on mouse-over on the row. You can set this title in the settings of each node type in the section Title for Interactive Rows.  Content box header in the Overview Engine |
| Context Menu Actions | Actions in the context menu should not have only an icon, but also a label. If the label is not wanted, then you must at least set a title. This text will be used for mouse-over on the icon and as hidden text for screen readers. |

### Print Model

The print engine generates documents in the accessible PDF/A format. This format supports the "tagging" of all elements in the PDF document in order to make them available for assistive technology such as screen readers.
The tagging is automatically done by the Print Engine so that the majority of the accessibility requirements are already fulfilled by default.

However, there are a few rules that you need to comply when creating content.

#### Text Styles

| **Feature** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Headings** | When you define the text styles for your headings, you need to select the correct semantic information for them.  The main heading should have the semantic "Headline 1". All subsequent headings should have a coherent structure (e.g. "Headline 3" as subheading of "Headline 2").  Once you have defined these text styles, you can use them for adding headings in the Segment or Section tab. |
| **Body Text** | When you define the text styles for body text, you need to select the semantic "Paragraph".  The font size for standard text should be at least 12 pt so that the text is easily readable. |

#### Element Library

| **Element** | | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Text** | Headings | Use the correct text style for headings (see Text Styles). Select field for text styles |
| Text highlighting | Use as little italic, underline and color highlighting as possible, because this makes texts harder to understand for people with cognitive deficits and for screen reader users. |
| Alignment | Don’t use text alignment "Justified", because it makes texts harder to understand for people with cognitive deficits. |
| Color | * When using other font colors than black (+ white background), make sure that the contrast ratio is at least 4,5:1 between text color and background. * Don’t use only color to convey information (e.g. green for success), because this information is not accessible to people with color blindness and it will get lost in black and white print. |
| Lists | Please be aware that semantically correct lists cannot be created yet with the Print Engine. |
| **Image** | | * Use short, precise alternative texts which convey the important information of the image. * Info graphics need more extensive alternative texts which describe all the important information. * Don’t use images that contain important text (exception: logos), as the text might not be perceivable for users with visual impairments. Use the text element instead. |
| **Table** | | * Use the table only for real table use cases, not for layout purposes. * Don’t select the checkboxes for "Hide Label" or "Hide Header", because the column headers are important for screen reader users. * Make sure that the columns are wide enough so that the words have enough space and do not break onto the next line in the middle of the word. |
| **Table Layout** | | It’s not recommended to use this element.  Instead, you can use several text elements and arrange and style them as you wish. |
| **Charts** | | The charts are not accessible yet. |

## Developing

### General Requirements

There are some general accessibility requirements which need to be done by every project. The following are the most important ones in the developing process:

| Function | Requirement | Motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alternative Image Texts** | Every information-bearing image shall have a good alternative text. Usually this text should not contain more than 80 characters, only images with a high level of information (e.g. charts) should be described more detailed.  Decorative images which do not contain any relevant information, should have an empty alt tag (`alt=""`).  → *Needs to be done and customized by the project itself* | Blind and visually impaired users want to know about the content and information of an image in the same way as sighted users.  With an empty alt tag, the image is ignored by the screen reader instead of reading the image name, so that the user is not disturbed by irrelevant information such as the file name of the image. |
| **Text Formatting** | If a certain text or word should be highlighted in layout (bold, italic), then use  * <strong> tag for bold text * <em> tag for italic / emphasized text | When the author of a text intends to highlight things by using bold or italic layout, blind users should be able to get this information as well as sighted users with the help of screen readers. |
| **Document titles** | Every web page / view should have an accurate and descriptive title. We recommend the following structure:  [Name of current page] - [Name of the web application]  For more information on how to define document titles see chapter [Basics](#_basics).  → *This needs to be implemented by the project itself, an example can be seen in the* [Widget Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/) | Every web page / view should have an individual, accurate and descriptive title, so that different pages can be easily distinguished (e.g. in browser tabs, Google search results, for bookmarks). |
| **Localization** | For non-English languages the localization shall be used also for accessibility hidden texts. These are important to provide necessary information for screen reader users and are implemented firmly in the widgets.  For all German and English default hidden texts no customization is needed: For specific invisible texts, widgets provide the React component "HiddenText". Other texts are used in `title` attributes or as `aria-label` to provide a name for an element so it can be read by screen readers.  → *A project needs to use the language provider given by A12, see Widgets Showcase* → [Accessibility](https://a12.mgm-tp.com/showcase/#/basics/accessibility) | When a project has other screen languages than English, then the hidden texts for blind users shall be localized, too. |
| **Main Language** | The main language is specified in the HTML DOM for the whole application and it changes accordingly if the application provides a function to switch the language.  How it is done in the A12 client:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` config.store.subscribe(() => { const htmlElement = document.querySelector("html"); const { language } = LocaleSelectors.locale()(config.store.getState()); if (htmlElement !== null && htmlElement.getAttribute("lang") !== language) { htmlElement.setAttribute("lang", language); } }); ``` | ```  → *This needs to be implemented by the project itself, an example can be seen here:* [Client Sample Application](https://a12-internal-client-master.pidev.mgm-tp.com/index.html) (mgm internal only) |  |

### Focus

#### Visible and Invisible Focus

For keyboard handling it is essential to have a visible focus indicator, so that the users always know where they are. This means that every element that gets the **focus by tab key** must have a **clearly visible** focus design. The most common focus indicator is a visible border displayed around the focused user interface.

However, there is also a second type of focus which is not set by the user, but by the application. This happens for example when a modal opens or a detail view is opened next to master view. The focus is needed there as well, so that every user will recognize what is happening. But in contrast to the focus set by tab key, **the focus set by the app can be invisible** - depending on the concrete use case:

* If the focus is set on an interactive element (e.g. input field, button) → the focus has to be visible
* If the focus is working like a jump mark to an HTML element (mostly the title-element or the outer container of a widget) → the focus can be invisible

The invisible focus is especially helpful for screen reader users, because when content (e.g. a message box) appears after an interaction, the focus will be set in the box (more precisely on the div-element or the headline of the box) and the screen reader will start reading the content of the box. The next tab key will then set a visible focus on the next interactive element within the content container.

Technical hint:
In Chrome the invisible focus gets a visible outline by the browser specific style itself. This can be prevented by setting the outline=none via CSS. This was also done for the example of Master Detail Pattern, see [Focus Concept for Certain Patterns](#_focus_concept_for_certain_patterns).

**Examples**

| **Invisible Focus** | **Visible Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| * Pop Up Menu when the List is opened (same for Multilingual Field) * Menu when the sub-menu is opened * Modal Notification * Modal Overlay * Toasts * Tooltip | * Filter Selector → Focus is set into first input field, input field has focus design |

#### Focus Order

When keyboard users navigate sequentially through web content, the focusable components should receive focus in a conclusive and understandable order. This is especially important when content is created dynamically.

Also, usually only interactive elements should receive focus by tab key.

**Linearization**

The visible order of elements on a page or view should be represented in the HTML DOM. There may be different orders that reflect logical relationships in the content (like a table that can be navigated cell by cell or row by row), but in general the tab order should follow the language reading order left to right. This means for example that when there are two boxes floating side by side, the left one should get the focus first, then the right one and after that elements below the boxes.

#### Focus Concept for Certain Patterns

The general rule for the focus change after any event of trigger action is that the focus should go to the content which is newly displayed, so that screen reader users will notice the change. If this content is closed again, the focus should go back to the initial trigger element. A more detailed focus concept is provided for the following patterns:

##### Engine to Engine: Master Detail

Rule of Master Detail Pattern:

There is a button or another interactive element to open the next pane. After this action is triggered, the new pane opens and the focus is set on top of this new content in order to start reading and tab navigation from there. When the new pane is closed, the focus is set back to the trigger element and has a visible focus to show the user position.

###### Example: Master Detail Managed in Widgets Showcase

Each view should have an `id` to get the focus behavior.

You can see the usage in the Widgets Showcase: [Master Detail Managed](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/layout/master-detail#managed)

For the different trigger actions, the focus concept is the following:

| **Trigger Action** | **Focus Behaviour** |
| --- | --- |
| **Add** | The focus will be on the added view. The *id* of the trigger open element should be provided *onNext*, so that this trigger element will be focused when removing the added view. |
| **Remove** | The focus will be on the trigger open element if its *id* is defined, otherwise, the last visible view will be focused. |

###### Example: Master Detail Pattern used in the A12 Sample Application

The Master Detail Pattern is used between Overview Engine and Form Engine.

The interactive rows and / or edit buttons of the master can be focused and get the visible focus indicator. When a row is selected (Overview Engine) the detail view opens (Form Engine).

An example implementation of this concept can be seen in the A12 Sample Application: [Client Sample Application](https://a12-internal-client-master.pidev.mgm-tp.com/index.html#section:Examples,feature:FocusHandlingProgressIndicator) (mgm internal only)

For the different trigger actions, the focus concept is the following:

| **Trigger Action** | **Focus Behaviour** |
| --- | --- |
| **Edit** | With Enter on a row or on an edit button in the Master view, the focus should be on the start of the newly opened content (= Detail view).  When the Detail is closed (e.g. with cancel or submit button), the focus should get back on the row respectively edit button in the master that was selected. (Exception: When the Master view has a pagination and the edited or newly added entry is not shown in the actual view because it was placed on another page, the focus should be set onto the Master table instead.) |
| **New** | When a new entry is added, the focus also goes to the opened Detail view.  * When hitting Cancel, the focus goes back to the Add button. * When hitting Submit/Apply, the focus goes to the newly added row in the master. (Exception: see Edit) |

##### Overview Engine: Delete

| **Trigger Action** | **Focus Behaviour** |
| --- | --- |
| **Delete** | When an entry in the master is deleted, the focus is set to the next row (or to the next interactive element if the deleted row was the last entry).  If the deletion process is canceled, the focus gets back to the trigger element (delete button). |

##### Form Engine: Repeat

The focus behavior is working automatically when the A12 feature Repeat is used. If there are similar use cases without the usage of Repeat this pattern must be applied by the project itself.

**Inline Repeat**

| **Trigger Action** | **Focus Behaviour** |
| --- | --- |
| **Add / New** | The focus shall be set to the new row. The focus itself shall not be visible, but the row should have a highlight design. The next focus (by tab key or arrow down key) goes to the input field. |
| **Edit** | (Nothing special here) |
| **Delete** | After deleting an entry, the focus is set on the table. When the deletion process is canceled, the focus is set back to the trigger element / delete button and is visible. |
| **Cancel** | When an action is cancelled, the focus is set back to the trigger element. |

**Detached Repeat**

| **Trigger Action** | **Focus Behaviour** |
| --- | --- |
| **Add / New** | For all of these actions, the editing form is shown in a new view (or page), where the focus should start on top of the form.  Save:  * After the editing form is closed, the focus shall be set to the new / edited element respectively row * If the row is non-interactive it has highlight design, if it is interactive it has focus design * The next TAB would go to next interactive element (e.g. button in the row or after table) → normal tab order  Cancel:  * After the editing form is closed, the focus is set back to the trigger element, (e.g. the ADD / NEW button, the EDIT button or the interactive row) → normal tab order from this element on |
| **Delete** | *See Inline Repeat above* |
| **Cancel** | *See Inline Repeat above* |

##### Pagination

After a new page is selected from the pagination, the focus should go to the content which is newly displayed. The first TAB should set the focus on the first interactive element on the new content. If there are no interactive elements on the new content, the focus should follow the normal tab order that includes interactive elements before the pagination and the pagination itself.

This is supposed to work out-of-the-box for certain pattern like Repeat using pagination, but it should definitely be checked when content and pagination are implemented - especially if the pagination is not used with a table. If the focus is not set automatically as described above, the focus shall be set on the wrapper by the project. See an example with focus on table wrapper while using pagination: [Table Expandable in Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table/basic#expandable)

![Pagination](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/plasma/accessibility/assets/pagination.png)

The pagination tab order should be as following:

* Focus starts on the *First Page* button
* TAB → Focus is on the *Previous Page* button
* TAB → Focus is on the input select

  + Works as normal input select
  + After choosing a page: select page and set focus on the top of the new page (or new content)
* TAB → Focus is on the *Next Page* button
* TAB → Focus is on the *Last Page* button

### Widgets

Most of the A12 widgets provide a good accessibility automatically. But sometimes the use of certain properties and adjustment is needed. For some widgets there is an accessibility version provided in the Widgets Showcase → always use this version. Otherwise, the basic version is accessible.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is recommended to use the A12 widgets instead of manually developed components. If a component must be developed manually, it should get checked for accessibility by the A11Y experts. |

For the following widgets, there are properties provided to make them accessible. The values of some properties will need further customization depending on the function of the widget.

#### General Widgets

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Button** | *buttonAttributes* | Sometimes a button (or icon button) needs special attributes for accessibility. To get those aria attributes onto the button, use the property *buttonAttributes*.  **Use Case "Open content"**  A button is used to open another content connected to this button. This needs to be told to the user in an accessible way by using aria attributes. There are two required aria attributes:  * `aria-expanded` with value true (when expanded) and false (when closed) → buttonAttributes={{"aria-expanded": true / false}} when button is clicked / not clicked * `aria-haspopup` with value true if the content to open is a pop up menu → buttonAttributes={{"aria-haspopup": true}}  Some widgets with the functionality to open another content have those aria attributes set per default. Check if your settings have them already or if they need to be added by *buttonAttributes*.  Examples for widgets which need to set those aria attributes  * Filter Selector → button to open / close the filter selector * Table → Expandable → button to open / close the editable content of table row * Charts → Hideable Legend → button to open / close the legend * Split View → Button to split / not split the contentbox |
| Open / Expand content | If a button opens a pop up menu or expands content, it shall follow these rules:  Content opening in a **pop up** → use A12 widget Pop-Up Menu  Content **collapsing** / de-collapsing → use A12 widget Collapsible Panel |
| Icon Button: *title* | For reading and mouseover of an Icon Button it needs a good name similar to the Icon widget. This is done by the `title` attribute. An additional requirement is to have also an `aria-label` so that the Icon Button can be used by voice control software. Therefore, the `title` attribute and `aria-label` are mandatory for accessibility and shall always have the same value. To set it to the Icon Button use the *title* property and it will be used as `title` attribute and `aria-label`.  Title of Icon Button  HTML for Title of Icon Button  Special: If the Icon Button is used to open another content connected to the button, then the name needs to reflect this and change depending on whether the content is open or not. See also widget Button.  Examples of widgets where the name must be given by the *title* property and may be changed depending on functionality:  * Table → Expandable → button to open / close the editable content of table row * Charts → Hideable Legend → button to open / close the legend * Split View → Button to split / not split the contentbox * Modal Notification → Close button * Callout → Close button * Resize and Drag Container → Draggable Button Element * Simple Toggle Button |
| **Icon** | *title* | For blind users using the screen reader and as a hint while mouseover of an icon it needs a good name. The name is then displayed as a tooltip by the `title` attribute and used as non-visible text in the HTML-code. The value can be set by the property *title*.  Title of Icon  HTML for Title of Icon |
| **Link** | Open / Expand content:  `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `role` | See "Button → Open / Expand content": If a link opens a pop up menu or expands content, it shall follow the same rules. |
| **Pop Up Menu** | *triggerButtonTitle* | When the pop up menu is used more than once per view / page they should have individual names for mouseover effect and for screen readers. Therefore, a customized title for the origin trigger button is needed. It can be changed with the property *triggerButtonTitle* and should be localized if needed.  As default, it will be "Open menu" in English, and "Menü öffnen" in German. |
| HeaderTrigger | If you use the HeaderTrigger widget, you need to decide if the hidden screen reader text "selected" is suitable in your use case or not. If you use the widget e.g. for a language switch, then you can keep the default of the *hideHiddenText* property. If you use it e.g. for a user menu, then you should set the property to true, so that the hidden text will be removed.  See Widget Showcase [Popup menu](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/general/popup-menu) for examples. |

#### Widgets for Layout

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Collapsible Panel**  Deprecated, please use widget Typography instead. | *role* and *ariaLevel* | If the collapsible panel is used as section header it should be also a header on a semantic meaning. Therefore, it needs the `role=heading`, which is provided by the use of the property *role*. In addition, the property *ariaLevel* is needed to get the heading in the correct hierarchy by setting a level. |
| **Content Box** | *ariaLabel* | Sometimes it is needed to name a certain content box for a better screen reader reading, e.g. for the master detail use case. To write a special name which is read to the content box, use the property *ariaLabel*. |
| *ariaLevel* | The heading hierarchy of an application is very important. The content box headline has the `role=heading` by default, but needs to have a logical heading level. It can be set by the property *ariaLevel*.  Attention: The form engine is calculating the heading level automatically and there is no need to manually change the property *ariaLevel*. |
| *headingTitle* and *ariaLevel* in footerProps | If the footer of a content box contains content (like interactive elements such as an submit button), it needs a heading as well in order to provide a good programmatically determined structure. By default it has the invisible heading "Action Section" (in German "Aktionsbereich") which is read by screen readers.  But if more than one content box footer is used on one view / page, then it is necessary to have individual invisible headlines for them. You can customize the footer headline by using the property *headingTitle* from *footerProp*.  The hierarchy of the footer headline should be set automatically by the engines, like for the contentbox header. But it might be necessary to set the level of the hierarchy manually. This can be done with the property *ariaLevel* from *footerProps*. |
| **Layout Grid used as Gallery** | *role* | It is recommended to use the property *role* for the layout grid widget when it is used as a gallery. With this property, the layout grid / gallery will be set as list (semantic meaning of list, no design change).  For further info see typedoc instruction in the widget showcase for *LayoutGridTemplateProps* and *RowProps*. |
| **Responsive Image Container** | *alt* | To provide alternative texts for images, fill the `alt` attribute by using the property *alt*.  **Card widget**  The card widget is using the responsive image container widget and therefore should also use the property *alt* to set a good alternative text. |

#### Widgets for Navigation

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Breadcrumb** | *currentPage* | The active page is marked as "current" by using the property *currentPage* on the last breadcrumb element which generates `aria-current=page` as attribute on the last breadcrumb item. |
| **Menu - Flyout Menu, Sliding Menu** | *mainContainerLabel* | Use the property *mainContainerLabel* for the main navigation only to give it a semantic name. This is recommended for blind users using the screen reader. Set the `aria-label` with text in all languages you need, for example:  * English: "Main navigation" * German: "Hauptnavigation" |
| *title* | If a menu item contains only an icon and no text, it needs a name (set by `title` attribute and `aria-label`) to be read by screen readers. This can be done by the *title* property. |
| **Menu - Sliding Menu** | id | Each menu item needs an *id* so that the keyboard focus will get back on the parent item when collapsing its sub-menu. These ids will automatically be generated when you give the Sliding menu an *id*.  However, if you customize the menu items in a way that their labels are not plain text anymore, you need to manually give each menu item an *id*.  If you are unsure, let an accessibility expert test it. |
| *onTabOut* | When the Sliding Menu is expanded, it shall have a tab circle between the end of the menu and the button to collapse/expand the menu.  * The function set by property *onTabOut* will trigger when the user presses the tab key to move the focus out of the last menu item. After the last menu item, the next tab goes to the sliding menu button to collapse/expand the menu. * The project itself must handle it to move the focus on the button to collapse/expand the menu when *onTabOut* was fired. |
| **Tab Panel** | *id, title* | The Tab Panel needs an *id* and each tab needs its own *title*. This way, the title of the tab panel will be also read when navigating into the content of the selected tab panel. |
| Badge | When you use a badge, you need to set the *id* of the badge as value of the *ariadescribedby* property, so that screen readers can read the badge’s information. |

#### Widgets for Data Entry

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **All inputs** | *inputProps* | Use the property *inputProps* for putting other than default attributes onto an input, e.g.:  * Mandatory fields  + Use *inputProps* to set the aria attribute `aria-required=true` * Fields for user-related information  + All inputs that relate to the user oneself shall have the correct `autocomplete` attribute, see list here: [WCAG 2.2 Input Purposes](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#input-purposes)   + Use *inputProps* to set the `autocomplete` attribute for input, e.g. `autocomplete=name` |
| *id* | All inputs shall have a linked label (`for` attribute on label, `id` attribute on input) → The `for` attribute will be added to the label if you supply an `id` for the input. This includes also checkboxes (the switch widget is a checkbox!) and radio buttons. |
| *hideLabel* | If an input is not having a visible label on the screen, there shall be a label anyways in HTML-code. Use the property *hideLabel* to make the label invisible on the screen but still available for blind users using the screen reader. This is also required for inputs inside tables, for file upload and for both inputs of a year / month selector.  If an input has a placeholder, this placeholder will be set automatically as hidden label. |
| *ariaDescribedby* | Input with tooltip:  * Each information tooltip shall have its own ID, and that ID shall be passed as value of the property *ariaDescribedby* in order to link information tooltips to the input. (Hint: Other tooltips for warning and error are linked automatically.)  Input with affixes (prefix and suffix):  * Each affix shall have its own ID, and that ID shall be passed as value of property *ariaDescribedby* to link these additional (text) information to the input. * This is for text affixes or counter or other affixes as additional information and NOT for interactive affixes like buttons. Buttons, e.g. date picker or "clear all" button, shall not be linked to the input. |
| keyboard use | If the input has a function besides normal typing or selecting an option, this function must be accessible by mouse and keyboard likewise. For example the input like text line can have a functionality triggered by a double click with the mouse. It is important that this functionality is also available by keyboard. This is fulfilled:  * when the double click is only a shortened way for functionality which is available anyway (e.g. by a menu) or * when there is a keyboard short cut which is to be defined by project. |
| errors and warnings | Error and warning states of an input can have a different color. For accessibility it is required that they need to be indicated not only by color, but also by a validation message or icon or anything else to indicate the invalid field. |
| **Autocomplete** | *ariaDescribedby* | The Autocomplete widget is using a special dropdown list functionality. Therefore, it is needed to link the label and all other information belonging to the field onto the dropdown list. This way, the label and other information are read by screen readers when the focus is in the input, has value and the list is opened. The linking is done with the property *ariaDescribedby* which needs the IDs of the following elements:  * `<label>` → premise: set property *id* * validation message (error and warning) → premise: set property *id* * validation tooltip (error and warning) → premise: set property *id* * tooltip which is not validation (information etc.) → ID has to be set manually, since it is an addon passed in via the property *addonAfter*  See Widget Showcase for more information and example: [Autocomplete](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-entry/autocomplete) |
| **Checkbox** | *title* | When the label of a checkbox is not visible on the screen the *title* property can be used to have a visible tooltip for mouseover effect on the checkbox. |
| *ariaControls* for indeterminated checkbox | To get a connection between the parent checkbox and the belonging child checkboxes it is needed to link the IDs of the child elements to the parent element with the attribute `aria-controls`. This connection is programmatically determined and can be read by screen readers. The value of *ariaControls* has to contain the list of controlled checkbox IDs. |
| **Custom Select - Horizontal Mode** | hidden text or placeholder | When used in horizontal mode, the custom select should have a hidden text or placeholder which instruct the user to use the arrow keys left/right/up/down. |
| **File Upload** | *placeholderIconTitle* | With the property *placeholderIcon* a certain preview icon can be set for the file upload widget. This preview icon shall get a name which is read by screen readers, too. The name can be set by using the property *placeholderIconTitle*. |
| *id* | If the widget **FileUpload** is used customized instead of the widget **DefaultFileUpload**, then it is necessary to use the *id* property, which will create IDs for all elements inside the file upload (e.g. label, tooltip) and link them to aria-labelledby and aria-describedby attributes. See also [Widget Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-entry/file-upload). |
| **Plugin Editor** | adding customized buttons:  *createButtonGroup* and own properties (including *title*) | The default buttons in the Plugin Editor already have hidden texts and localization. If a project wants to customize button groups or use other than default buttons (e.g. Mark Text button), it needs to use *createButtonGroup* or *createBlockButton* and pass its own properties (including *title*). |
| **Radio Button** | *groupDOMProps* | If the radio button group is set as mandatory this must be given also in a way to be programmatically determined, for example to be read by screen readers. With the property *groupDOMProps* the attribute `aria-required=true` must be passed into the radio group wrapper. |
| **Tag Input** | *keys* | The keys to create a tag is set by the property *keys*. The default is to press "," (comma key) for creating a tag. For accessibility it is recommended to also set ENTER as a key to create a tag to meet user expectations for keyboard handling. |
| *ariaLabelledby* | The Autocomplete and Tag Input widgets are using a special dropdown list functionality (see table entry **Autocomplete** above for details).  The only additional requirement for the Tag Input is to also link the ID of the helper text (premise: set property *id*).  See also Widget Showcase [Tag Input](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-entry/tag-input) for further information and example. |

#### Widgets for Data Display

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Badge** | *title* | There are default invisible texts and texts shown on mouseover. The invisible texts are necessary to detect the meaning of the badge element read by screen readers. These texts can be customized with the property *title*.  **Badge used on Icon Button**  The icon button widget uses the attribute `aria-label` for reading by screen readers. Because only the aria-label is read (the invisible text of the badge widget is ignored) the aria-label must contain the information of the badge. This is done by using the property *title* for the icon button widget as well as for the badge widget.  It is recommended to set the same *title* for both widgets to show the same text on mouseover. |
| Tiny Badge - contrast | The A12 default colors for widget Tiny Badge don’t fulfill contrast requirements (for information-bearing icons the contrast ratio has to fulfill 3:1.). Therefore it is not recommended to use them with A12 default colors. |
| **Card** | with interactive elements | Depending on the number of interactive elements and the desired hover effect, different card variants should be used. See following decision tree:  Card Widget decision tree |
| Advanced Linked Card: *useLinkRole* | If the Advanced Linked Card widget is used:  * The property *useLinkRole* for the ActionArea should be set to "false" (in order to remove `role="link"`)  + For the main target of the Linked Card widget, the link widget should be used inside the first or main card content container (depending on project priorities)   + This link widget shall repeat the same link-target of the Linked Card widget (CSS might be customized so that there is no underline of the link text) * All further interactive elements are added with Link widget or Button widget in the card content container |
| **Counter** | with Tooltip / with Title | We recommend to use the counter with tooltip.  With Title: It is not recommended to use the counter widget with title since the `title` attribute is mostly not accessible by screen readers for elements which contain text. The `title` attribute should be used only for graphical elements like icon buttons. |
| *hiddenDescription* | This property can be used to add a hidden description text to counters, e.g. in the dual pane when using different types of counters. This will be read by screen readers before the counter value (e.g. "Deleted: [4 entries]"/"Gelöscht: [4 Einträge]"). We also recommend to use different icons for different types of counters. |
| **List** | *selected* | If the list has interactive list items which represent a selection of options the selected option will be marked visually with a checkmark icon. To differentiate programmatically between the normal buttons (they have `aria-pressed=false` as default) and the pressed button, the attribute `aria-pressed=true` is needed. It can be set to true with the property *selected.* |
| interactive list item with button → not recommended | For semantic reasons it is not recommended to use the list item as interactive wrapper with other interactive elements inside. Instead, the list item itself should not be interactive and the main action should be made available via button or icon button. |
| **Pagination** | *id* | The pagination is using a select field and therefore this must be linked to the invisible label with the for-id-linking, see chapter [Widgets for Data Entry](#_widgets_for_data_entry) for more information. To have this linking, the ID is to set with property *id*. |
| **Status** | *title* | If you are using only the icon without text, you need to set the *title* property in the Icon widget. |
| color | In flat theme, the warning variant is not accessible, because the white text has not sufficient contrast to the orange background. |
| **Table & Tree Table - Basic** | readable text | All content of a table shall be readable - by visible text or by invisible text for screen readers. If a table contains any graphical content, e.g. icon buttons, or content without visible text, e.g. inputs, they must follow the general accessibility requirements. For special types and use cases of these widgets, see the table "Table and Tree Table" below. |
| **Tooltip** | *id* | If the tooltip belongs to an input it must be connected to it. This is done by giving the tooltip widget an ID by property *id*. See chapter [Widgets for Data Entry](#_widgets_for_data_entry) and properties *id* and *ariaDescribedby* for more information. |

##### Table and Tree Table

The widgets Table and Tree Table are using the same API. Although not all use cases are provided for Tree Table in Widgets Showcase, all properties and adjustments available for Table could be used for Tree Table as well.

When the Table widget is rendered by the engines, it uses the Textoutput widget for the cell content. There is no accessibility difference for using or not using Textoutput widget, both work the same.

| **Type or Use Case** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Column Header without visible text** | hidden text | If a table header cell doesn’t contain visible text it must contain invisible text which can be read by screen readers. This is especially important for tables with a column for actions and no visible text or just icon buttons in the table header. The column header text should be a generic word like "Status" or "Action" if the column contains only status icons or buttons. |
| **First cell contains interactive element** | hidden text | Button or other interactive element in 1st cell of a row:  If the first cell of a row contains only an interactive element like a button, invisible text is recommended in front of the button for proper focus and reading by screen readers. If the row is interactive the differentiation between row function and button function can be difficult. The invisible text has to be modelled or implemented manually. |
| **Interactive rows** | *title* | If rows are interactive and trigger an action (e.g. edit, open detail view, open modal, …​), they need a title specific to the interaction. This title is then shown by mouseover and read by screen readers. To localize the title, see chapter [Developing](#_developing) → General Requirements → Localization.  For example:  * Table Select and Sort, see [Table in Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table/basic): The title should be "Selectable" and after selection "Selected" * Tree Table Selectable, see [Tree Table in Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/tree-table/basic): The title should be "Selectable" and after selection "Selected" * Master Detail pattern → table in the Overview: The title should be "Open detail view" (example for German would be "Detailansicht öffnen") |
| **Marked rows** | *secondaryCellTitle*,  *cellStyling* | A row can be marked, e.g. as secondary. This can not only mean a secondary relevance but also a selection, pre-selection or highlight. The marked row can be interactive or not. This information which is seen by design shall be given to the blind users as well with an invisible text inside the first cell of a row.  With the property *secondaryCellTitle* the hidden text can be set at the first secondary cell of the row with a default localized content, see example in Widgets Showcase in [Table with Customizations](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table/basic#customizations).  For other use cases there are also default hidden texts, for example the highlighted row. When a row is highlighted by the property *rowStyling* the property *highlightVariant* with value "*success*" will set a default localized hidden content, see example in Widgets Showcase in [Table with Customizations](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table/basic#customizations) and [Tree Table Highlight](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/tree-table):  * English: "Success" * German: "Erfolg"  **Customized hidden text**  The default content can be overwritten with the property *cellStyling* (the same implementation as *useSecondaryColor*).  Pro-tip: If the first cell contains also visible content, the hidden text should be written with a comma to have a breathing space of reading by screen readers, e.g. "Success,". |
| **Name** | *ariaLabel* / hidden text | To differentiate between different tables / tree tables or to give them a name for a better understanding of their meaning, it is necessary to set a name with the property *ariaLabel* (for tables) or set a hidden text (for tree tables). The default name for the Table widget is "Table" (en) / "Tabelle" (de).  This is especially important when the table switches to the card view and is then not a table-element in HTML-code anymore → A good name should be given or the `aria-label` should change.  **Interactive rows**  Tables and tree tables with interactive rows should have an invisible information which informs blind users about how to trigger the function, since rows are usually not interactive.  For tables, this information can be added by using the property *ariaLabel*. Example sentence:  * English: "You can trigger the row action with Enter on a cell." * German "Zeilenfunktionen können mit der Eingabetaste in einer Zelle aktiviert werden."  For tree tables, you need to set the property *id*, which will be used to create a default hidden text (identical to example sentences above) and will be linked to the `ariaLabelledby` attribute. It is also possible to link the `id` of another hidden text or content with the *arialabelledby property*.  If you want to replace the default text by your own customized text, you can do it by wrapping the *A11YResourcesContext* (see [Widget Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/basics/accessibility)). |
| **Row groups - Widget Table only** | *ariaLabel* | The title of the group shall be passed also as `aria-label` for the group by property *ariaLabel*. Screen readers can then recognize and read it as grouping. |
| **Sortable column header**  with another interactive element | *contentWrapperRole* | If the sortable column header is used together with another interactive element such as a tooltip, the property *contentWrapperRole* must be set to **false**. In addition, a custom role should be passed to the other interactive element via this property (e.g. button for the tooltip widget).  Background: The sortable header cell has `role="button"` by default so that screen readers can recognize it as an interactive element. But if there is another interactive element within the cell, this leads to syntax errors. With the property *contentWrapperRole* the `role="button"` " is removed from the cell itself and instead the header name gets the role=button and the other second interactive element can get a role as well. |
| **Table footer** | *hasFootContent* | If the table footer is used to display content, the property *hasFootContent* needs to be set to true so that the necessary aria attributes are rendered as well. |
| **With context menu** | Keyboard shortcut | When the context menu is used for the rows, the buttons of the menu should be the same for the right-click menu as for the three-dot menu.  If this is not possible, then there needs to be a shortcut implemented which opens the right-click menu (plus documentation for this shortcut).  We don’t recommend to use the context menu for the column header. If you really need to use it, then you must provide a shortcut which opens the menu (plus documentation for this shortcut) and you should let an accessibility expert check it. |
| **With Icon Button inside table body** | *title* | When the widget Icon Button is used inside the table, the `title` attribute and `aria-label` must be filled just like it must be done for alone standing icon buttons, see widget Icon Button in chapter [General Widgets](#_general_widgets). |
| *buttonAttributes* | For the type of Table widget where an icon button is used to expand editable row content, e.g. [Table Expandable in Widgets Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/widgets/data-display/table/basic#expandable), the icon button needs `aria-expanded` attribute set by property *buttonAttributes*. Also, the `title` attribute should be changed depending on status. See widget Icon Button in chapter [General Widgets](#_general_widgets). |
| **With inputs** | hidden label | If an input e.g. text line, checkbox or indeterminated checkbox (used for multiselection function) is used inside a table it needs a label as it is default requirement for all inputs. See chapter [Widgets for Data Entry](#_widgets_for_data_entry).  For tables, most times the label is not visible and therefore needs to be set as hidden label with text in all project-languages.  Example for multiselection in a table with indeterminated checkbox in table header:  * English: "De/Select all" * German: "Alle auswählen / abwählen" |
| *title* | Input in table header:  If a table contains an input without visible label in the table header, e.g. indeterminate checkbox for multiselection, a title to show on mouseover is needed. Use property *title* for this → title shall be filled then with text of hidden label. |
| **Not accessible types** | no recommendation | Unfortunately there are types of Table and Tree Table widgets which are not accessible for screen reader users. It is NOT recommended to use them for projects that need to support accessibility.  **Column Group Table and Tree Table**  Because of the complicated HTML structure of grouped columns, the screen reader is not mapping table header and cell content correct. At the moment there is no solution known to provide accessible groups for column headers.  **Editable Row Table**  The use of the opened editable row is causing problems for the screen reader NVDA so that the column names are mapped incorrect to the cells. At the moment there is no solution known for this problem.  **Virtualized Table**  Because of the complicated HTML structure of the table body, the screen reader NVDA on Firefox couldn’t detect columns and rows correctly. At the moment there is no solution known for this problem. |

#### Widgets for Feedback & Utils

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Global Message Box** | *ariaLevel* (default value: "level 2"),  *role* (default value: *"heading"*) | By default, the global message box is used as a heading, which is done by giving it the property *role=heading*. To place it correctly in the heading hierarchy, it has also the property *ariaLevel*, which is set on level 2 by default.  If these settings don’t match with the structure of a web application, they can be customized:  * By changing the level of the heading → set a different `aria-level` (>0) * With no heading at all → without `role` and `aria-level` * By changing the `role` (not recommended) → Please note that this `role` must be an element which allows using `aria-level`, see [WAI ARIA - aria-level](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-level). Such a change should be approved by the A11Y experts. |
| *focusOnMount* (default value: "true") | The default use case for global message box is to be shown as global information on a web application and when it appears first it should get invisible focus. Users will then get to know the message when the viewport is scrolled to the message and screen reader starts reading there.  This functionality is set as default behavior by property *focusOnMount*. If the global message box is used in a different use case or the focus should not be shifted to it, the focus behavior can be turned off by setting the property to "false".  In case of multiple global message boxes, the focus should be set only on the first box. |
| color | In flat theme, the warning variant is not accessible, because the white text has not sufficient contrast to the orange background. |
| **Toast** | Header | It is strongly recommended to always use a header for the toast. |
| Connected Toast: *focusOnOpen*  (default value: "true") | For the default use case (connected toast shown on a button without changing the view), the focus is set automatically to the opened content.  If you have a use case where the focus should NOT get into the opened content, set the property *focusOnOpen* to "false".  Example: The connected toast appears on an input which includes the content of the toast also in the placeholder text of the input. |
| Toast Group:  *type*, *activityID* | Only the toast *type* "permanent" is recommended for A11Y, because it gives the users enough time to read and use the content (exception: when used in combination with the notification center).  If you want the notification to disappear after a certain activity (e.g. cancel, commit, or when leaving the view), it is necessary to always provide an activity id for the activity to which the notification should be bound. |
| Toast Group stackable | When the stackable toast group appears, it doesn’t get the keyboard focus, but it is still read by the screen reader due to the property role="status".  For better accessibility, you should implement a keyboard shortcut so that users can quickly reach the toasts. This shortcut should be documented in the accessibility declaration. |
| `tabIndex` for main content | Only the permanent Toast Group is recommended for accessibility, because it gives the users enough time to read and use the content. When the toast is closed, the focus goes back to the element that triggered the action. If there is no such element, the focus will be set back to the main content (with `role=main`). Therefore it is important that the main content has a `tabindex`. |
| **Typography** | *ariaLevel* | It is necessary to use the property *ariaLevel* so that the screen reader can give the information that this is a heading and the level of the heading. These levels should have a meaningful hierarchy and can be independent from the level used for styling purpose. |

#### Widgets for Business Case

| **Widget** | **Property / Adjustment** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat** | *alt* for avatar | If the avatar of the chat partner is a real image (and not plasma icon) it needs a good alternative text. The `alt` attribute should be used for  * telling the meaning of image   or * empty `alt` attribute for not reading image if it is not meaningful.  The alternative text is to set with property *alt* which is part of the *AvatarProps*. |
| **Login Layout** | Logo | The logo can have an `image` as child which needs a good alternative text. This is done by the `alt` attribute which can be empty if the image shall not be read and is only used for decoration. |
| *ariaLevel* for Headline | The heading hierarchy must be correct also for the login page. By default, the `aria-level` is 1 for the headline. It can be changed by using the property *ariaLevel*. |
| **Message Box** | *focusOnMessage* (default value: "true") | There are different use cases to show a message box and sometimes it needs focus and sometimes not. If the message box is generated by the web application it should get focus so all users will be aware of this information. Otherwise they might miss this information.  The focus is set as default behavior by property *focusOnMessage*. If the message box is used in a different use case or the focus should not be shifted to it, the focus behavior can be turned off by setting the property to "false".  In case of multiple message boxes, the focus should be set only on the first box. |
| **Validation Bar** | *autoFocus* (default value: "true") | The validation bar shall get focus when appearing so that all users will get the information about validation result. For blind users the reading by screen readers starts there and for all other users the viewport is scrolled up to the validation bar to present it in an accessible way. This is required for accessibility and is done as default focus behavior. Any ways it can be turned off by setting the property *autoFocus* to "false". |
| Mobile Use: *a11yTitleSupport* | On the mobile view of validation bar there are shown only the numbers and icons of errors or warnings. For reading by screen readers on mobile devices the property *a11yTitleSupport* must be set to "true" to have default localized invisible texts for the graphics. This property is recommended for only the Overview because the supported texts let users know they should click on the validation bar to see the Validation List or Detail.  For the Summary View, there are set default localized invisible texts on each issue dependent on the validation type. No property needed to have them. |
| **Wizard** | *title* | For the steps of the wizard, the *title* property should be used, so that they are readable and get a tooltip when they are truncated. |

#### A11Y in Progress

Some widgets are still in the process of accessibility improvement. They are not recommended for projects that need to support accessibility or they need a manual A11Y-proofed implementation.

| **Widget** | **Status Quo** |
| --- | --- |
| **Charts** | The charts are not yet tested for accessibility. But it is already known that they should have a good alternative text and should be presented with an invisible table including the same information for blind users. |
| **Comment** | The Comment widget with the types Single Comment, List Comment and Comment Container is not yet tested for accessibility. |

## Quality Assurance

Quality assurance is a core element of achieving accessibility, which is why accessibility tests should be integrated in the regular quality assurance process. The goal is to make sure that the application covers as many user needs as possible and fulfills the requirements of legal regulations (see chapter [Standards and Regulations](#_standards_and_regulations)). And although the complexity of the accessibility tests might seem very challenging at first, many of these tests can easily be executed by the project QA and don’t necessarily need an A11Y expert.

### Testing levels

Every project is of course different, but on a general basis we recommend the following three testing levels for quality assurance:

#### Ticket tests

The best way to ensure accessibility from the start is to include A11Y tests in the verification of a ticket.
Depending on the kind of change that was implemented in the ticket, the following should be tested:

* Every frontend change → check if the functionalities are available with keyboard as well
* Every change of the UI → check if all works well with browser zoom of 200%
* If there are new icons/graphics → check if there are alternative texts
* If there are new sections or pages → check if the heading hierarchy is correct
* If there are new components or fundamental changes → check the application on mobile devices

#### System tests / Regression tests

These tests are needed for a constant quality assurance of accessibility and should address as many accessibility requirements as possible.

We recommend using the accessibility test suite in TMT which includes all standard accessibility test cases and can be found [here](https://tmt.mgm-tp.com/p/23/sp/_/v/1.0.0/s/2/cases). If you are already using TMT in your project, then you just need to request reading rights for the test suite.

#### High-level tests

These complex and extensive tests are aligned with the criteria of the WCAG / BITV requirements and should be executed by the A12 accessibility experts.

Usually, they are based on the BIK BITV self test, which consists of 98 [test steps](https://webtest.bitv-test.de/index.php?a=dl&t=s) (*only available in German*). These have been created by the BIK for their BITV test and are based on the EN 301 549.

The high-level accessibility tests are especially important

* before Go-Live, as reference for the accessibility statement
* as preparation for external tests (e.g. BIK BITV test)

### Testing tools

#### Screen reader

A screen reader is a program which reads out the content of a website to the user.
The output of the screen reader is not based on the visible content, but on the content of the HTML.

The following screen readers are currently the most common worldwide:

* NVDA for Windows
* JAWS for Windows
* VoiceOver for MacOS and iOS
* TalkBack for Android

For our tests, the open source screen reader NVDA is the standard tool, as it is the most popular screen reader and is also used by official BIK BITV testers. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/).

##### Navigation

For desktop, there are basically two ways to navigate a website:

* Use the down arrow key to navigate to each element on the page in turn (up arrow for back).
* Tab key to jump from one interactive element to the next (shift-tab for back)

On mobile, you can either swipe left to get to the next element (right for back) or you can touch the element that you want to hear. If you want to trigger an action (e.g. click on a button) you need to set the reading focus on the element and double tap. For scrolling down, you need to use two fingers (TalkBack) or three fingers (VoiceOver).

##### How to use NVDA

###### Operation modes

When using NVDA, you have two modes of operation:

**Browse mode**: For normal navigation on a page — within this mode you can navigate normally with arrow keys and tab key, as well as use short cuts, but you can NOT type in data.

**Focus mode**: For fields where data can be entered — within this mode you can type in data, but you can NOT navigate with the arrow keys, only with Tab, and also the short cuts usually don’t work.

Usually, NVDA automatically switches between the two modes, but you can also change them manually by pressing Insert + Space.

###### Shortcuts

For faster navigation through a page, there are many keyboard shortcuts available, such as:

| Function | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Next heading | H |
| Next form field (Input, …​) | F |
| Next link | K |
| Next table | T |
| Next list | L |
| Next list item | I |
| Stop current reading | Control |
| Stop speech mode | Control + S |
| Exit NVDA | Insert + Q |

###### Settings and Tools

With Insert + N you can open the menu of NVDA.

In the settings you can change the **reading speed** and activate the **visual highlighting** of the currently read out object.

In the tools the most important feature is the **Braille Viewer**, which displays in written form the information that is currently being read out (and sometimes even additional information). On the braille display, abbreviations and symbols are used for certain semantic information like "selected radio button". An overview of these can be found [here](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html?#Braille).

#### Color contrasts

For checking the contrast ratio between background and foreground colors, you can either use the tool **Color Contrast Analyser** (<https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/>) where you can select the color on the screen via pipette.

Or you can use one of several **websites** where you put in the color codes of both colors, for example here: <https://www.w3docs.com/tools/color-analyzer>.

Another possibility is the browser extension **WCAG color contrast checker**, which lists all contrasts of the page and also indicates where a contrast might not be sufficient.

If you are unsure about the contrast requirements, you can look them up in chapter [Contrast](#_contrast).

#### Headings

The most efficient tool for testing headings and their levels is the browser extension **headingsMap**. You can directly see all headings of a page and their hierarchy. The tool also indicates by red color which headings are not in correct order (e.g. headings don’t start with level 1, incorrect order of heading levels).
