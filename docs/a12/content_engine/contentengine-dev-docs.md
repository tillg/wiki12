# Content Engine

## Introduction

The Content Engine is designed to transform content models into interactive and visually appealing user interfaces using A12 Widgets.
It converts content models into React components, ensuring consistent styling and behavior across applications.
This engine supports extensive customization of styles, layouts, and interactions, making it adaptable to various project requirements.

The Content Editor offers a developer-friendly interface for creating and managing content.
It features a WYSIWYG editor with drag-and-drop functionality and inline editing, simplifying the content creation process.
Integrated seamlessly with the Content Engine, the Content Editor ensures that all modifications are accurately reflected,
allowing for consistent and flexible content management.

## Content Engine

### Getting Started

#### Installation

Content Engine is provided as an npm package. The following command installs the necessary npm packages:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install @com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core ``` |
```

In addition, it is necessary to install other A12 packages as peer dependencies of the Content Engine,
such as Base, Widgets, Client, and others.

#### Setup

##### Create Content Model

As usual, to have a Content Engine, you need to create a Content Model.
The Content Model is a JSON object that describes the structure of the content.
The Content Model is used to create the Content Editor, which is used to create and edit content.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Content Editor is not a part of the Simple Model Editor (SME) like other UI models. |

##### Update the Application Model

Assume we have a Content Model with the name `welcome-page`. To add the Content Model to the Application Model, follow these steps:

1. Add a new menu item to the Application Model for the Content Engine view
2. Add a new scene to the Application Model to configure the view

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 ``` | ``` {   "header": {},   "content": {     "region": { },     "defaultRegion": [],     "modules": [       {         "name": "welcome-module",         "menu": {           "name": "welcome-menu",           "initialActivity": {             "withoutData": true,             "descriptor": {               "model": "welcome-page"             }           }         },         "flows": [           {             "name": "welcome-flow",             "scenes": [               {                 "name": "welcome-scene",                 "matchConditions": [                   {                     "key": "model",                     "mustEqual": "welcome-page"                   }                 ],                 "sceneChange": {                   "onEnter": [                     {                       "type": "REGION_CLEAR"                     },                     {                       "type": "VIEW_ADD",                       "name": "ContentEngineView",                       "models": [                         {                           "modelType": "content",                           "name": "welcome-page"                         }                       ]                     }                   ]                 }               }             ]           }         ]       }     ]   } } ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `name` field in the `VIEW_ADD` action (`ContentEngineView`) must match the component name registered in your ViewComponentProvider (see next section). |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Though the `withoutData` field in the `initialActivity` indicates that the view does not need any data to be loaded initially, after reloading the application, if the default Client deep linking is enabled, errors will be thrown because the view cannot find the model to load. This is a known limitation of the Client deep linking feature. |

##### Register to ViewComponentProvider

The Content Engine view must be registered with the application’s ViewComponentProvider to make it available for rendering.

Register to ViewComponentProvider

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` import * as React from "react";  import { type View, FrameFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { DefaultElementLibraryFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library";  export function createViewProvider() { 	const crudViewProvider = createEngineViewProvider();  	return function viewProvider(componentName: string): React.ComponentType<View> { 		return ( 			crudViewProvider(componentName) || 			FrameFactories.viewProvider(componentName) || 			(() => <Placeholder componentName={componentName} />) 		); 	}; }  const Placeholder: React.FC<{ componentName: string }> = ({ componentName }) => { 	return <div>ERROR: NO CONTAINER FOUND for {componentName}</div>; };  function createEngineViewProvider(): (componentName: string) => React.ComponentType<View> | undefined { 	const components: { [name: string]: React.ComponentType<View> | undefined } = { 		// OverviewCRUD: (props) => <CRUDViews.OverviewEngineView {...props} />, 		// FormCRUD: (props) => <CRUDViews.FormEngineView {...props} />, 		// The component name here should be matched with the scene Directive "VIEW_ADD" in the application model 		ContentEngineView: (props) => <DefaultElementLibraryFactories.ViewComponent {...props} /> 	};  	return (name) => components[name]; } ``` |
```

Key points about the registration:

* The component name `ContentEngineView` in the provider must match the `name` field used in the Application Model’s `VIEW_ADD` action
* The `DefaultElementLibraryFactories.ViewComponent` provides the default Content Engine rendering capabilities
* A fallback `Placeholder` component is provided for unregistered components

##### Setup Application

The application setup depends on whether you’re using static or dynamic content models:

**For static content models:** Only the `ElementLibraryRegistry` registration is required.

**For dynamic content models:** Both the `ElementLibraryRegistry` and additional data handling components (`DataProvider` and `DataReducers`) must be registered.

Register the ElementLibraryRegistry and Data Handlers

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` import { ApplicationFactories, type ApplicationSetup } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { DefaultElementLibrary } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library"; import { ContentEngineFactories, ElementLibraryRegistry } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core";  export function setup(): ApplicationSetup { 	ElementLibraryRegistry.get().addEntry(DefaultElementLibrary.get());  	return ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ 		...otherConfigurations, 		dataHandlers: [ 			// other data handlers 			ContentEngineFactories.createDataProvider() 		], 		dataReducers: [ 			// other data reducers 			...ContentEngineFactories.createDataReducers() 		] 	}); } ``` |
```

###### Setup Components Explained

`ElementLibraryRegistry`
:   Registers the default element library that provides standard Content Engine components (text, images, containers, etc.)

`DataProvider`
:   Handles data fetching and management for dynamic content models

`DataReducers`
:   Manage state changes and data transformations for content operations

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For production applications, consider implementing custom element libraries by extending the default library to meet your specific requirements. |

### Key Concepts

#### Content Model

The Content Model provides a blueprint for structuring, storing, and rendering content within applications.
It follows the base A12 model schema, with the primary difference being the top-level `content` field.
This model defines various types of content elements, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Elements can be categorized into built-in and custom types, allowing for standardized and project-specific content.
These elements can be nested to create hierarchical structures, which facilitate well-organized content layouts.
For example, a grid element can contain multiple row and column elements, each holding other content elements like text, images, or videos.
This hierarchy ensures that content is structured logically and can be easily managed and manipulated.

Content Model interface (simplified)

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 ``` | ``` import { type Header as BaseHeader } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.base/base-model-api";  export interface ContentModel { 	readonly header: ContentModel.Header; 	readonly content: ContentModel.Content; }  export namespace ContentModel { 	export interface Header extends BaseHeader { 		readonly modelType: "content"; 	}  	export interface Content { 		readonly root?: Node; 		readonly configuration?: Configuration; 	}  	export interface Node<Props = unknown> extends IdName { 		/** 		 * Node's type 		 */ 		readonly type: string; 		/** 		 * Node's properties 		 */ 		readonly props: Props; 		/** 		 * Node's children 		 */ 		readonly children?: Node[]; 		/** 		 * A reverse domain, dot-separated, lowercase string that uniquely identifies the group of related elements 		 */ 		readonly namespace: string; 	}  	export interface IdName { 		readonly id: string; 		readonly name?: string; 	}  	export interface Configuration { 		readonly baseGroupId?: string; 		readonly namespaceVersions?: Record<string, string | undefined>; 	} } ``` |
```

#### Element

An Element is an abstract type-level entity, similar to a class in programming.
It defines the properties that its instances (that we will call **element nodes** or just **nodes**) will have.
A Content model can contain multiple nodes of the same element.

Node interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` export interface Node<Props = unknown> extends IdName { 	/** 	 * Node's type 	 */ 	readonly type: string; 	/** 	 * Node's properties 	 */ 	readonly props: Props; 	/** 	 * Node's children 	 */ 	readonly children?: Node[]; 	/** 	 * A reverse domain, dot-separated, lowercase string that uniquely identifies the group of related elements 	 */ 	readonly namespace: string; }  export interface IdName { 	readonly id: string; 	readonly name?: string; } ``` |
```

For example, an engine team can define a `Badge` element with properties like `variant`, `count`, and `tiny`.

JSON representation of a Badge node

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {   "id": "badge-a7b8d6e3",   "namespace": "com.mgmtp.a12.my-engine",   "type": "Badge",   "props": {     "variant": "warning",     "count": "3",     "tiny": true   },   "children": [] } ``` |
```

Below is some important information about the element node:

##### Namespace

The `namespace` is a reverse domain, dot-separated, lowercase string that uniquely identifies a group of related elements.
It helps prevent naming conflicts between different elements with the same name, e.g, one project may have a `Table` element
while another project may also have a `Table` element, but they are in different namespaces.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Content Engine use the namespace `com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine` for its default elements. |

##### Type

The `type` is a string that identifies the type of the element, e.g, `Box`, `Text`, `Image`, etc.

##### Id

The `id` is a unique identifier for a node within a content model.

##### Properties

The `props` field contains the properties of the node. The properties can be any type, including primitive types, objects, or arrays.
It is up to the element module to interpret and render these properties. For example, a `Badge` element may have properties like `variant`, `count`, and `tiny`.

##### Children

The `children` field contains an array of child nodes. This field is used to create a hierarchical structure of nodes.

##### Version

Instead of including `version` in node level, it is declared in the `content.configuration.namespaceVersions` map
with the key is the namespace and the value is the version of the namespace, e.g, the following model declares that
the `com.mgmtp.a12.my-engine` namespace is at version `1.0.0`, which means that all elements in this namespace are at version `1.0.0`.

A part of a Content model with namespace version

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {   "header": {},   "content": {     "root": {},     "configuration": {       "namespaceVersions": {         "com.mgmtp.a12.my-engine": "1.0.0"       }     },   } } ``` |
```

#### Element Module

An **Element Module** (or **Module**) defines how an element behaves within the Content Engine. It acts as a blueprint,
detailing the rendering and interaction logic for the element.
The simplest interface for an Element Module includes an identifier (see below), a renderer and an optional version field.
The identifier specifies which element the module corresponds to,
while the renderer is a React component receives the modeled properties and returns the corresponding UI component.

ElementModule interface (simplified)

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` export interface ElementModule<Node extends ContentModel.Node = any> { 	/** 	 * The unique identifier of the module. 	 */ 	readonly id: ElementModule.Identifier;  	/** 	 * The version of the module. 	 */ 	readonly version?: string;  	/** 	 * The renderer for the node type. 	 */ 	readonly renderer: React.ComponentType<NodeRendererProps<Node>>; } ``` |
```

##### Identifier

The Element Module Identifier is a concentrated string between the namespace and the type of the element, i.e: `<namespace>:<type>`.

For example, the identifier for a `Badge` element in the `com.mgmtp.a12.my-engine` namespace is `"com.mgmtp.a12.engine:Badge"`.
In runtime, to find the responsible module for a node, the Content Engine will join the namespace and the type of the node to get the identifier,
then use it to find the corresponding module.

##### Version

The `version` field is an optional string that specifies the version of the module. It should match identically the version of the element in the content model,
which is declared in the `content.configuration.namespaceVersions` map.

##### Renderer

The `renderer` is a React component that receives the modeled properties and returns the corresponding UI component.

#### Element Library

An Element Library is a collection of element modules managed together.
It facilitates the organization and usage of various modules within the Content Engine.
Each library has an identifier and methods to retrieve modules,
making it easier to manage and utilize a consistent set of modules across different parts of the application.

The Element Library serves several key purposes. It centralizes management by grouping element modules,
simplifying updates and maintenance. It ensures consistency by using the same set of modules throughout the application.
Libraries promote reusability, reducing redundancy and improving development efficiency.
Additionally, they allow for customization by combining built-in and custom elements tailored to specific project needs,
enabling easy adaptation and extension of the Content Engine’s capabilities.

Element Library interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` export type ElementLibrary = Library<ElementModule>;  export interface Library<Module extends Identifiable = Identifiable, Configuration = unknown> extends Identifiable { 	/** 	 * The modules in the library. 	 */ 	readonly modules: Module[];  	/** 	 * The configuration of the library. 	 */ 	readonly configuration: Configuration; } ``` |
```

A library (e.g., ElementLibrary) can be created by constructing a plain object that implements the `Library` interface.

To create a modified version of an existing library—such as adding or removing modules—standard JavaScript techniques
can be used to produce a new object based on the original, ensuring immutability is preserved where needed.

### Features

#### Content Engine Actions

The `EngineAction` interface defines a standardized representation of user interaction events within the Engine.
By encapsulating essential details, such as the target node and the contextual information in which the event occurs,
it enables a structured, consistent approach to event handling.

EngineAction interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` import { type Action } from "typescript-fsa";  export type EngineAction = Action<EngineAction.Payload>; export namespace EngineAction { 	export interface Payload { 		/** 		 * The node that triggered the event. 		 */ 		readonly target: Target; 		/** 		 * The path to the group instance that triggered the event. 		 */ 		readonly groupInstancePath: string; 	}  	export interface Target extends Pick<ContentModel.Node, "namespace" | "type" | "id"> {} } ``` |
```

The **EngineAction** is specific to the Engine and does not have awareness of the context to which it belongs.
This can be problematic when multiple instances of the Engine are required, potentially leading to conflicts between instances.

To address this, the **ContentEngineAction.EventPayload** interface is introduced, enabling the addition of context to core EngineAction events.
This is primarily achieved by including the **`activityId`**, which identifies the activity to which the event belongs.

ContentEngineAction.EventPayload interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` export namespace ContentEngineAction { 	export interface EventPayload { 		readonly activityId: string; 		readonly engineAction: EngineAction; 	} } ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content Engine does not have Command action concept like other Engines or the [Content Editor](#content-editor-actions). |

This action is defined inside the [Element Module](#_element_module), and the Content Engine will dispatch it when
an event is triggered by a user interaction through elements.

##### Handling Node Events

Developers need to listen for these actions to handle node events accordingly. Node events are used to react to changes or actions performed on nodes within the system.
Please refer to the [Event](https://geta12.com/docs/content_engine/contentengine-user-docs/index.html#_event) section for how to configure the events at the element level.
You can implement event handlers in multiple ways:

###### Using Reducers

The most direct approach is to handle events in reducers, which provides immediate response to user interactions:

Handle Node Event with Activity Reducer

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` import { type AnyAction } from "typescript-fsa";  import { ContentEngineAction } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core"; import { type Activity, type ActivityReducers } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { ButtonNode } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library";  export const contentEngineEventDataReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 	reduce( 		dataHolders: Activity.DataHolder[], 		action: AnyAction, 		_defaultDataHolder?: Activity.DataHolder 	): Activity.DataHolder[] { 		if (ContentEngineAction.event.match(action)) { 			if (ButtonNode.onClick.match(action.payload.engineAction)) { 				// handle the button click event 				// perform synchronous data transformations 				return updateDataHolders(dataHolders, action.payload); 			} 		}  		return dataHolders; 	} }; ``` |
```

###### Using Sagas

For complex asynchronous workflows and side effects, implement event handlers as sagas:

Handle Node Event with Sagas

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` import { takeLatest, type SagaGenerator } from "typed-redux-saga";  import { ContentEngineAction } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core"; import { ButtonNode } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library";  export function* handleContentEngineEventSaga(): SagaGenerator<void> { 	yield* takeLatest(ContentEngineAction.event.match, (action) => { 		const { engineAction } = action.payload;  		if (ButtonNode.onClick.match(engineAction) && engineAction.payload.eventName) { 			alert( 				`Button clicked with event name "${engineAction.payload.eventName}" in context "${engineAction.payload.groupInstancePath}"` 			); 		} 	}); } ``` |
```

Sagas are ideal for handling complex asynchronous operations, such as:

* Making API calls in response to node changes
* Orchestrating multi-step workflows
* Managing long-running processes
* Coordinating between multiple systems

###### Using Middlewares

For simpler synchronous processing and transformations, middlewares provide a clean approach:

Handle Node Event with Middewares

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` import type { Middleware } from "redux";  import { ContentEngineAction } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core"; import { InteractiveTileNode } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library";  export function createContentEngineEventHandlerMiddleware(): Middleware { 	return () => (next) => (action) => { 		if (ContentEngineAction.event.match(action)) { 			const { engineAction } = action.payload;  			if (InteractiveTileNode.onClick.match(engineAction) && engineAction.payload.eventName === "my-event") { 				alert( 					`Interactive tile clicked with event name "${engineAction.payload.eventName}" in context "${engineAction.payload.groupInstancePath}"` 				); 			} 		}  		return next(action); 	}; } ``` |
```

Middlewares are suitable for:

* Data validation and transformation
* Logging and auditing
* Simple synchronous business logic
* Cross-cutting concerns like authentication checks

###### Registration

You can register your event handlers in two locations:

* **Content Engine Module**: Register handlers specific to your module’s functionality
* **Central AppSetup**: Register global handlers that affect the entire application

This flexibility allows you to organize your event handling logic based on scope and responsibility.

#### RequestSelectorMap

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This API is marked as experimental. Breaking changes **might** happen even in minor releases. |

The `RequestSelectorMap` can be used to customize the requests of the default data provider of the Content Engine.
The Content Engine internally uses a default variant of this map, but you can provide your own implementation containing your customizations.
Then it will be used in place of the default one.

For example, customizing the way the Data Provider loads a single document can look like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 ``` | ``` import { 	type Module, 	type DataProvider, 	type ActivityReducers, 	type ApplicationSetup } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { 	ContentEngineFactories, 	type RequestSelectorMap, 	DefaultRequestSelectorMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core";  /**  * Here, requests for loading documents are customized with another parameter.  * Instead of reusing the default, you could also create your own.  */ export const CustomRequestSelectorMap: RequestSelectorMap = { 	...DefaultRequestSelectorMap, 	load(config) { 		return (state) => { 			const defaultRequest = DefaultRequestSelectorMap.load(config)(state);  			return { 				...defaultRequest, 				params: { 					...defaultRequest.params, 					additionalParam: "customValue" 				} 			}; 		}; 	} };  /**  * Depending on how you set up your application, you can now use the `CustomRequestSelectorMap`  * when creating the data provider for the Content Engine.  */  /**  * Via a single Content Engine Client Module:  * <project>/client/src/modules/index.ts  */  export const ALL_MODULES: Module[] = [ 	// other modules... 	ContentEngineFactories.createModule({ requestSelectorMap: CustomRequestSelectorMap }) ];  /**  * Or via application setup with separate module components:  * <project>/client/src/appsetup.ts  */  export function setup(): ApplicationSetup { 	const dataHandlers: DataProvider[] = [ 		// other data handlers... 		ContentEngineFactories.createDataProvider({ requestSelectorMap: CustomRequestSelectorMap }) 	];  	return ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ 		dataHandlers, 		dataReducers: [ 			// other data reducers... 			...ContentEngineFactories.createDataReducers() 		] 		// other configurations... 	}); } ``` |
```

Note that it is mandatory to spread the `DefaultRequestSelectorMap` when customizing.

This customization approach can also be used in combination with the RequestFilter API
(described in the [Data Services documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#json-rpc-modifying-requests)),
for example to use your own operation methods.
Customizing the `RequestFilter` alone would not be enough when the method replacement needs some context
(e.g. only overriding methods in certain conditions). Using the `RequestSelectorMap` could then be used to provide this context down for the filter to use.

#### Screen Reader Column

|  |  |
| --- | --- |

The Screen Reader Column feature improves accessibility for tables that contain interactive elements such as buttons, interactive tiles, or checkboxes in action columns.
When a table has multiple rows with identically labeled actions (e.g. several "Delete" buttons), screen reader users cannot distinguish which button belongs to which row.
This feature connects those interactive elements with a descriptive column’s content via `aria-labelledby`, so a screen reader announces both the action label and the row context (e.g. "Delete, Product ABC").

##### How It Works

The table node accepts an optional `screenReaderColumnRef` property that references a column by its ID.
When configured:

1. For each body row, the table resolves the cell in the referenced column and makes its DOM ID available via a React context.
2. Interactive elements (Button, InteractiveTile) in **action columns** read this cell ID using the `useTableScreenReaderContext` hook.
3. They set `aria-labelledby` on themselves, referencing both their own ID and the screen reader cell’s ID.
4. The browser and screen reader natively resolve the combined label from both referenced elements.

This approach is robust because it delegates text resolution to the browser — no manual text extraction is needed.

##### Configuration

To enable the feature, set the `screenReaderColumnRef` property on the Table node in your Content Model to the ID of the column whose content should provide row context:

Content Model excerpt

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {   "type": "Table",   "namespace": "com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine",   "props": {     "columns": [       { "id": "name-col", "width": "1fr" },       { "id": "action-col", "width": "auto", "actionColumn": true }     ],     "screenReaderColumnRef": "name-col"   } } ``` |
```

###### Requirements

* The referenced column (`screenReaderColumnRef`) must contain descriptive text that identifies the row (e.g. a name or title).
* The column with interactive elements must have `actionColumn: true`.
* The screen reader column and the action column **must not** be the same column.

###### Supported Elements

The following built-in elements automatically use the screen reader context when placed inside an action column cell:

* **Button** — sets `aria-labelledby` combining the button ID and the screen reader cell ID
* **InteractiveTile** — sets `aria-labelledby` via `htmlAttributes`

##### Custom Element Integration

Custom element modules can consume the screen reader context using the `useTableScreenReaderContext` hook exported from `@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core`.
The hook returns `undefined` for `screenReaderCellId` when the element is not inside an action column, so it is safe to use unconditionally.

Custom element using screen reader context

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` import * as React from "react";  import { type ContentModel, useTableScreenReaderContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core";  export const CustomActionModule = moduleFactory<CustomActionNode.Props>("CustomAction", ({ node }) => { 	const { id, props } = node;  	// Read the screen reader cell ID from the table context. 	// Returns undefined when the element is not inside an action column. 	const screenReaderCellId = useTableScreenReaderContext((context) => context.screenReaderCellId);  	return ( 		<button 			id={id} 			aria-label={props.label} 			onClick={() => { 				/* handle click */ 			}} 			aria-labelledby={screenReaderCellId ? `${id} ${screenReaderCellId}` : id}> 			{props.label} 		</button> 	); });  export type CustomActionNode = ContentModel.Node<CustomActionNode.Props>;  export namespace CustomActionNode { 	export interface Props { 		readonly label?: string; 	} } ``` |
```

The key pattern is:

* Read `screenReaderCellId` from the context.
* If present, set `aria-labelledby` to `"${ownId} ${screenReaderCellId}"` — this tells the screen reader to announce both the element’s own label and the referenced cell’s content.
* Keep `aria-label` as a fallback for when the element is used outside a table.

## Content Editor

### Content Editor Actions

The editor *actions* are divided into two types: ***Events*** and ***Commands***.

**Events** signal that something has happened in the UI, triggered by a modeler interaction. For example select an element in Content Editor.
They are handled by middlewares and will never change the state directly.
They can be dispatched by users, for example `Events.onSelectNode` to select specific [Element in Content Engine](#_element).
Developers are also encouraged to listen to them, for example to `Events.onDeleteNode` to get notified about an element being deleted from the Engine.

**Commands** are used to directly modify the ***Redux*** state. They are dispatched by other *Events/Commands* and are usually implemented in reducers.
Users are encouraged to dispatch them, for example `Commands.setSelectedNode` to disable the UI, but are **NOT** encouraged to listen to them.
Which commands are dispatched in what order and by what user interaction is considered an implementation detail
and a change is not considered breaking.

**Why are actions separated into events and commands?**

This helps to understand the runtime behavior better, because you can rely on the effect of actions
only creating other actions or changing the state. This makes maintenance, customizing, and debugging easier.

It also serves as a reminder not to listen to commands when you want to react to some user interaction.
Which event is dispatched by what user interaction is fixed. Which commands are dispatched as a result might change and should not be relied on.

#### Events

All UI-Events trigger the dispatching of a ***Redux*** action. The behavior, which gets triggered by these events, can be changed by registering custom middlewares.

The following table describes what each action does and what user interaction leads to the action.

For a more details e.g.: action’s payloads, please refer to the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/content_engine/contentengine-dev-docs/generated/typedoc/editor/modules/Events.html).

| **Event** | Description | Dispatched by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| onChangeConfiguration | change the Content Editor configuration | the settings button in the toolbar |
| onChangeSetting | change an element’s properties via its setting UIs | the settings panel |
| newOnChangeSetting | change an element’s properties via Redux | the settings panel |
| onSelectNode | select an element | a click event on an element in the canvas or tree panel |
| onToggleConditionalNodeVisibility | toggle the visibility of the `Conditional node` element on the canvas | the preview button on the `Conditional node` tree element |
| onInsertNode | insert an element | the insert button in the context menu |
| onMoveNode | move an element | the move buttons in the context menu and the toolbar |
| onDeleteNode | delete an element | the delete button in the context menu and the toolbar |
| onCopyNode | copy an element | the copy button in the context menu and the toolbar |
| onCutNode | cut an element | the cut button in the context menu and the toolbar |
| onPasteNode | paste an element | the paste button in the context menu and the toolbar |
| onDuplicateNode | duplicate an element | the duplicate button in the context menu |
| onInlineEditNode | allow raw editing of an unknown element inside the Content Model | the inline edit button in the settings panel |
| onChangeLexicalState | open or closes the Content Editor lexical view | the editing button in the canvas’s elements |
| onSaveLexicalChanges | save the lexical editing state | the "done" button in the canvas’s lexical editing |
| onConfirmDialog | confirm a dialog action | the confirm button in the dialog |
| onCancelDialog | cancel a dialog action | the cancel button in the dialog |
| onClickSettingPanelButton | open or close the settings panel | the settings panel toggle button in the toolbar |
| onClickComponentPanelButton | open or close the component panel | the component panel toggle button in the toolbar |

#### Commands

All direct state changes are coming from these actions. However, it is not recommended to listen to these actions directly.
What **Commands** are dispatched at what time and in what order is considered an implementation detail and may change any time in a ***non-breaking way***.

It is possible to register custom reducers to take care about how information is stored.
But be aware that the engine components always need the store in a special structure to be able to render!

The following table shows an overview of all **Commands**.

For a detailed description, including the specific payloads, please refer to the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/content_engine/contentengine-dev-docs/generated/typedoc/editor/modules/Commands.html).

| **Commands** | Description | State Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| setModel | set Content Model | `contentModel` in `ModelState` |
| setSelectedNode | set selected node state | `selectedNode` in `UIState` |
| setSettingScreens | set list of setting screens | `settingScreens` in `UIState` |
| setInsertPanel | set insert panel’s information | `insertPanel` in `UIState` |
| setShowSettingPanel | set setting panel’s visibility | `showSettingPanel` in `UIState` |
| setShowComponentPanel | set component panel’s visibility | `showComponentPanel` in `UIState` |
| setDialog | set dialog information | `dialog` in `UIState` |
| setVisibleConditionalNodes | set map of visible Conditional nodes | `visibleConditionalNodes` in `UIState` |
| updateSettingsState | update a specific Content Model’s element following the selected node | a specific node of `contentModel` in `ModelState` |
| resetSettingsState | reset setting state from selected node | `settingsState` of the selected node in `UIState` |
| rescueSettingsState | revert to the **latest valid** setting state | `settingsState` of the selected node in `UIState` |

#### Client Actions

The commands and events are specific to the engine and doesn’t aware of the context where it belongs to.
This can be a problem when multiple instances of an engine are required thus can generate conflict between instances.
Therefore, the `ContentEditorClientActions` namespace is introduced to allow adding context to the core events and commands.

The main point of this namespace is to add extra layer of information, like including the `activityId` and
other Client’s related information. The following table shows an overview of every action.

For a detailed description, including the specific payloads, please refer to the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/content_engine/contentengine-dev-docs/generated/typedoc/editor/modules/ContentEditorClientActions.html).

| **Actions** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ContentEditorClientActions.event | A wrapper action for **Editor Events** while also includes the `activityId` |
| ContentEditorClientActions.command | A wrapper action for **Editor Commands** while also includes the `activityId` |

## Content Model Migration

### Installation

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install -D @com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-model-migration ``` |
```

### CLI Usage

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npx content-model-migration <path> ``` |
```

Where `<path>` is the relative or absolute path to the content model file, or the directory containing the files.

For other options, run `npx content-model-migration --help`.

If the project is using other elements from 3rd-party packages and they deliver their own `Migrator` (see below),
it may need to have a configuration file to configure the migration process.

First, create a file named `content-model-migration.config.ts` in the same level with `package.json` file where declare the above package.
Then, import the `Migrator` from the 3rd-party package and add it to the `migrators` array in the configuration file, e.g:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` import { defineConfig, DefaultMigrator } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-model-migration";  import { OtherPackageMigrator } from "other-package";  export default defineConfig({ 	migrators: [DefaultMigrator, OtherPackageMigrator] }); ``` |
```

The tool will automatically detect the configuration file and use the `migrators` array to run the migration process.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The file name can be changed to any name, with the extension `.ts` or `.js` (CommonJS format). In that case, the `--config` option can be used to specify the path to the configuration file. |

### API Usage

For element module developers, the `Migrator` interface is provided to create a migration script for their elements.
They can freely decide where to store the migration logic, but to reduce the bundled size of the final application,
it is recommended to create a separate package for the migration logic.

Assume that the `Badge` element needs to be migrated to make the `size` field required.
In that package’s `src` folder, create a folder named `v0.0.0` with a file named `badge.ts` inside. Copy the current
interface of the `Badge` element, e.g:

v0.0.0/badge.ts

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` import type { ContentModel } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core";  export type BadgeNode = ContentModel.Node<BadgeNode.Props>; export namespace BadgeNode { 	export interface Props { 		readonly size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg"; 	} } ``` |
```

Then, create another folder named `v1.0.0` with the same file named `badge.ts` inside. Update the interface of the `Badge` element,
and provide the `transform` function to convert the old node to the new node, e.g:

v1.0.0/badge.ts

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` import type { ContentModel } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-core";  import type { BadgeNode as OldBadgeNode } from "../v0.0.0/field-output.api";  export type BadgeNode = ContentModel.Node<BadgeNode.Props>; export namespace BadgeNode { 	export interface Props { 		readonly size: "sm" | "md" | "lg"; // It is required now 	} }  export function transformBadge(oldNode: OldBadgeNode): BadgeNode { 	return { 		...oldNode, 		props: { 			...oldNode.props, 			size: oldNode.props.size ?? "md" 		} 	}; } ``` |
```

Finally, create a file named `index.ts` in the root of the package to export the `Migrator` object, so other projects
can import it in their configuration file, e.g:

index.ts

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` import { Transform, type Migrator } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-model-migration";  import { transformBadge } from "./steps/v1.0.0/badge";  export const MyEngineMigrator: Migrator = { 	namespace: "com.mgmtp.a12.my-engine", 	steps: [ 		{ 			version: "0.0.0" 		}, 		{ 			version: "1.0.0", 			transform: Transform.combineWithMap({ Badge: transformBadge }) 		} 	] }; ``` |
```

## Migration Instructions

### 2025.06-ext2

#### Breaking Changes

##### DocumentContext API Updates

The selectors/callbacks of the DocumentContext have been moved to separate fields to improve autocompletion and usability:

* Document-related selectors are now available under the `document` field of the context
* Model-related selectors are now available under the `model` field of the context
* Event callbacks are now available under the `events` field of the context

##### ImageNode Props Updates

The `src` field of the `ImageNode.Props` interface has changed from `string | undefined` to `Partial<Record<"static" | "dynamic", string | undefined>>`.

This change allows for more flexible image source configuration, supporting both static URLs and dynamic field references.

### 2025.06

Please refer to the [Migration to latest A12](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/migration_guide/index.html) chapter for an explanation of general steps.

#### Breaking Changes

##### Migration to ESM

All npm artifacts have been migrated from CommonJS to [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules).
When using Node.js `22.12+` and modern build tools, no changes should be necessary to your bundler setup.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If your tests depend on mocking/stubbing Content Engine API, consult the documentation of your test runner on how to work with ES modules. |

Migrating your own application to ESM is not required, but recommended. Consult the documentation of your bundler for specifics.

##### Updating to ES2024

The JavaScript output of the npm artifacts has been updated from `ES2020` to `ES2024` to enable the use of latest language features.
When using supported browsers, no changes are necessary. If support for older browsers is required, make sure to include necessary polyfills.

##### React 19 Upgrade

We have dropped support for React 18 and older versions and now require React 19 as our peerDependency.
This means you must perform the React 19 migration, which is described in detail in the official
[React 19 Upgrade Guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide). They provide codemods that should make the transition straightforward.

Additionally, we have decided not to include a Redux update to minimize the migration effort.
The "react-redux" library does not have React 19 as a peerDependency, but still works fine with it.
One solution is to override the dependency in your package.json. You also need to update the corresponding "@types/react-redux" typings to at least version 7.1.34.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` { 	"overrides": { 		"react-redux": { 			"react": "^19" 		} 	}, 	"devDependencies": { 		"@types/react-redux": "7.1.34" 	} } ``` |
```

##### Styled-components v6 Upgrade

We have dropped support for `styled-components` v5 and now require v6 as our peerDependency.
Please refer to the [styled-components migration guide](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-migrate-to-v6) and Widgets migration notes for more information.

##### Rework of Settings Template Components

In the `SettingsTemplate` namespace, components have been restructured for improved consistency and usability:

* `SettingsTemplate.SettingBody` has been removed without a replacement
* `SettingsTemplate.SettingHeading` has been renamed to `SettingsTemplate.Setting`
* The previous `SettingsTemplate.Setting` has been removed

##### Data Binding API Updates

The data binding APIs have been rewritten to provide a more consistent and powerful foundation for working with content models.

###### Interface Renaming

The `DataContext` interface has been renamed to `DocumentContext` to better reflect its purpose.
While its core callback signatures remain mostly unchanged, the first argument is now a string-form version of the `EntityInstancePath`
(e.g., `product[1]/addresses[2]/streets[1]`), referred to as `DocumentPath`, instead of a field or group ID.
Correspondingly, the `useDataContext` hook has been renamed to `useDocumentContext`.

###### New DocumentPathContext

To access path-related information in a structured way, a new context called `DocumentPathContext` is now available.
It provides the current `groupPath`, along with two utility methods:

* `resolveChildGroupPath` – resolves the full path to a child group
* `resolveFieldPath` – resolves the full path to a specific field

These changes help make path resolution more robust and aligned with a model-driven architecture.

###### Removed Components

As part of the cleanup, the following interfaces have been removed:

* The `DocumentService` interface and its default implementation `DefaultDocumentService`
* The `DocumentProvider` interface (was not actively used in the codebase)

These removals simplify the data binding system and remove unnecessary layers of indirection.

###### Direct DocumentContext Integration

All default elements are now wired to interact directly with the `DocumentContext`, both for reading values and writing changes.
This direct interaction ensures a consistent data flow across the application.

###### Simplified ContentEngine Setup

Setting up data binding in the `ContentEngine` component is now much simpler. Previously, it required supplying
a `DocumentService` and a `DocumentProvider`. Going forward, there are two supported approaches:

**Option 1: Data Binding Configuration**

Pass a `dataBindingConfiguration` object to the `dataBindingConfiguration` prop of the `ContentEngine` component.
This object must include `document` and `documentModel`. Optionally, it can also include:

* `baseGroupPath` to define an inner group path as the data binding base
* `onValueChanged` callback to handle value updates

When this configuration is used, `ContentEngine` will internally create a `DocumentContext` and configure data binding accordingly.

**Option 2: Custom DocumentContextProvider**

Alternatively, wrap the `ContentEngine` component with a custom `DocumentContextProvider`,
which provides a manually created `DocumentContext` instance.
This approach is suitable for cases requiring external control over the document context setup.

##### Drop Migration Support for Models Before Version 0.5.0

The migration tool no longer supports migration of Tree models before version 0.5.0.

If you need to migrate models from an older version, you must first migrate to version 0.5.0 using the migration tool of that version.
