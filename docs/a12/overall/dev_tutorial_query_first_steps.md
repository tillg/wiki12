# Task 1 - First Steps

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Query API > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/query/task-1-start** to follow along.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/query/task-1-end** to see how your requests differ from the solution.

## Use-Case

At first, you will receive an explanation of the Query API’s purpose and how projects will benefit from using it.

## End Result

Upon finishing this task, you will know:

* How you can benefit from using the new Query API.
* How to configure an A12 application to enable the Query API mode on server-side.
* How to modify the Document Models to be able to query for specific fields.
* How to create a first request using the new Query API.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

We will start by having a look at how to enable the query mode in a running application, how to mark specific Document Model fields to be relevant for querying, and also send our first query with the new API. Afterward, we will go through the different aspects of the API and how a general request is structured.

### Indexing

The search index of Data Services is an internal structure which enables performant querying for data. The respective data fields are stored in the `document_fields` database table. Only fields which are present in this table can be used in querying parameters.

By default, all Document Model fields are indexed.
To prevent a field from being indexed, explicitly add the annotation `indexed` with the value "false" to the corresponding data field.

![indexed contact last names](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_query_first_steps/assets/indexed_contact_last_names.png)

### Initializing Contact Data

Before we can really start discovering the new Query API with our own queries, we need some testing data. You can already find the predefined data under `import/data/request/initial_data.json`. This contains the definition of multiple documents for all Document Models in our workspace. These RPC operations will be executed during the start-up of the Init Application.

Start the application in following order to initialize the documents:

1. Run the `gradle build` command to build the project.
2. Run the `gradle :server:init:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env,init-data'` command to initialize the documents from our `initial_data.json`.
3. Run the `gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'` command to start the Data Services server.
4. Open a new terminal and go to the client directory `cd client` and start the frontend with the `npm start` command.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you already started the server application before, you have to stop it; otherwise the init application can not be started. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `gradle :server:app:bootrun` as well as the `npm start` are long-running-tasks. They will not terminate without being forced to. More details can be found in [Tutorials > General Information > Running the Code](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html#_running_the_code). |

If you access the application under `localhost:8081` and log in with the credentials:

* **Username**: "admin"
* **Password**: "A12PT-admintest"

You should see documents for the **Contact**, **Company** and **Employment** module.

![contact documents](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_query_first_steps/assets/contact_documents.png)

### First Query

Before we can send a request, we have to import the already prepared Bruno Collection for the first task and configure the access token properly.

1. Go to Bruno and click on the more options button in the top-left corner next to the logo **⋯**.
2. Select **Collections > Import Collection** and use the Bruno collection file `bruno/task1/collection-task1-start.json` in our project repository.
3. Open the **Query API Tutorial (TUT)** collection.
4. Click the **⋯** next to the newly imported collection and create a new folder named "Task 1 - First Steps" with the option "New Folder".
5. Click the "REQUEST TEMPLATE" request.

The access token will be used to authorize our HTTP requests for the Data Services server. You can read more about the access token and its purpose under [Tutorials > Backend > Custom Endpoint > Access Token](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/index.html#_access_token).

1. Go to the CRM application and receive your access token by following the instructions in [Tutorials > Backend > Custom Endpoint > Receiving an Access Token](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/index.html#_receiving_an_access_token).
2. Go to Bruno and click on the dropdown in the top-right corner **No Environment ↓**.
3. Click on "Configure".
4. Select "A12" environment on the left.
5. Clear the **Value** field for the **Authorization** variable, paste your access token without the `UAABEARER` prefix in the field, click the **Save** button and afterward the **Activate** button.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Everytime you import a collection from a new task tag it is necessary to set the `Authorization` variable in the environment configuration. |

Now everything is set up and we can extend the provided Bruno collections to create HTTP requests for the `QUERY` operation.

Use the "REQUEST TEMPLATE" request as a starting point and clone it by using the more options button **⋯** next to it and select "Clone".
Set the name for the new request to "All Contact Documents" and click **Clone**.
Move the cloned request to the folder "Task 1 - First Steps" by Drag & Drop.
The request body looks as follows:

File: `bruno/task1/collection-task1-start.json > Query API Tutorial (TUT) > Task 1 - First Steps > All Contact Documents`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` {   "id": "REQUEST TEMPLATE",   "jsonrpc": "2.0",   "method": "QUERY",   "params": {     "query": {       "targetDocumentModel": "<DOCUMENT MODEL NAME>",       "projectionName": "document OR cdd OR document-graph",       "paging": {         "pageSize": 10,         "pageNumber": 0       }     }   } } ``` |
```

We will fill out the placeholder values with proper ones, considering our model workspace. Therefore, insert the following data:

* `id`: "All Contact Documents".
  This is just a descriptive id for the request, it has no impact on the actual query.
* `targetDocumentModel`: "Contact\_DM".
  This defines for which Document Model we want to query documents.
* `projectionName`: "document".
  This specifies which kind of data we want to query. Queries are processed and structured differently for simple document data compared to CDD or document graphs.

Your request should then look like this:

File: `bruno/task1/collection-task1-end.json > Query API Tutorial (TUT) > Task 1 - First Steps > All Contact Documents`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` {   "id": "All Contact Documents",   "jsonrpc": "2.0",   "method": "QUERY",   "params": {     "query": {       "targetDocumentModel": "Contact_DM",       "projectionName": "document",       "paging": {         "pageSize": 10,         "pageNumber": 0       }     }   } } ``` |
```

You can either press **Enter** or use the **→** button on right side of the URL text field to send the request. The request result should contain a list of ten entries.

![request all contact documents](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_query_first_steps/assets/request_all_contact_documents.png)

This is the simplest query that we can create, which retrieves all contact documents stored in the database. We will explore all usable querying features in the **Discovering Queries** tutorial step.

Besides our `document` JSON content you can also see additional attributes for each result entry:

* `docRef`: The document reference, which identifies the document based on its Document Model name and its database UUID.
* `type`: Type of the result entry document. Values are "ROOT", "CHILD" or "LINK".
* `documentModelName`: The inferred Document Model of the result entry document. This might differ from the `targetDocumentModel` in case of heterogeneity or relationships being used.

### The New Query API

The newly introduced API handles data retrieval by specifying so-called "Selection" and "Projection" aspects in a query.

#### Selection

The query selection defines restrictions on which document data should be loaded. In database-terms: Which rows should be selected from a table full of entries. When no selection is applied, all documents for a specific Document Model are returned.

Key functionalities for the selection are as follows:

* Creating queries by concatenating logic and field-aware operators.
* Creating queries by using a simplified search operator.
* Creating queries whilst considering relationships using the `has` operator.

#### Projection

The query projection defines restrictions on which fields should be returned based on the root document. In database-terms: Which columns should be selected from a specific data set.

Key functionalities for the projection are as follows:

* Specifies the data that should be loaded additionally, after the selection is resolved.
* Retrieving only specific fields in the query response decreases the amount of unnecessary data processed and loaded. In the past, a query response would yield the whole document data with all respective fields, even if they were not needed.
* Retrieving additional linked document data which enriches the root documents.
* Retrieving partial link data by combining projection properties.

#### Request Structure

The `QUERY` RPC operation accepts structured requests with a specific format. These requests offer multiple optional properties that can be configured to create customized queries. Each query request contains a single parameter, `query`, which can be further defined using various properties.

In this section, we will examine the different parameters in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for creating advanced custom requests in subsequent tutorial tasks [Tutorials > Query API > Discovering Queries](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_discovering_queries/index.html) and [Tutorials > Query API > Migration](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_migration/index.html).

You can either use the REQUEST TEMPLATE from before or check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/query/task-1-end** to follow along with the upcoming examples for the various query parameters.

##### Query Parameters

Table 1. Query Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `targetDocumentModel`\* | Document Model name for which the query should be performed. |
| `sort` | Specifies the sorting of the query result documents. Data Services does not apply any sorting per default. |
| `paging`\* | Specifies the pagination of the query result. |
| `constraint` | Restricts the query result based on operators (e.g. logic operators on Document Model fields). |
| `fields` | Specifies which Document Model fields should be included in the query result. If not explicitly provided, all fields are included. |
| `links` | Specifies which link documents should be included in the query result. |
| `projectionName`\* | Specifies which projection type should be used for the query. Pre-defined are "document", "cdd", and "document-graph" as projection names. |
| `aggregation` | Specifies a function which can be applied to the query result. Supported functions are "avg", "count", "min", "max", and "sum". |
| `exclude` | Specifies whether root documents should be excluded from the query result. This is useful when only link documents are required. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

Each of these parameters consist of additional properties, which we will examine in the next sections. You will also be able to practice and use all of these in the following tutorial tasks.

##### sort Parameter

Defines the sorting behavior for the query result. It is possible to define the sorting based on multiple fields.

Table 2. `sort` Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `field`\* | Specifies the Document Model field path for which the query result should be sorted. |
| `direction`\* | Specifies the order for the sorting of the query result. Options are "ASC" for ascending and "DESC" for descending. |
| `nullHandling`\* | Specifies how `null` values should be handled for the sorting. Options are "NULLS\_FIRST" and "NULLS\_LAST". |
| `ignoreCase`\* | Specifies if the sorting should be case-insensitive. Options are `true` or `false`. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

See the following examples for the `sort` properties:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` "sort":[     {         "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/LastName",         "direction":"DESC",         "nullHandling":"NULLS_LAST",         "ignoreCase":false     } ] ``` |
```

In the example above, the query result entries will be sorted by the contact last name in descending order.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` "sort":[     {         "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/LastName",         "direction":"DESC",         "nullHandling":"NULLS_LAST",         "ignoreCase":false     },     {         "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/Nationality",         "direction":"ASC",         "nullHandling":"NULLS_FIRST",         "ignoreCase":true     } ] ``` |
```

In the example above, the query result entries will be first sorted by the contact last names in descending order and in case of documents
having the same last name, the second sort filter will take effect. This one will sort the entries based on the nationality in ascending order with null values being first in the order.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is recommended to use the "NULLS\_LAST" option because it is more efficient in terms of performance. |

##### paging Parameter

Table 3. `paging` Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pageNumber`\* | Specifies the page number to retrieve document data of the query result. |
| `pageSize`\* | Specifies the amount of entries for each query result page. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Pagination in Data Services starts counting from the index `0`. This means the first query result entries are available on the page with the number `0`. |

See the following example for the `paging` properties:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` "paging":{     "pageSize":5,     "pageNumber":1 } ``` |
```

In the example above, the query result entries are paginated containing five entries per page.
The page with index "1" is selected, meaning the entries on the second page are contained in the query result, while each page contains five entries.

##### constraint Parameter

Table 4. `constraint` Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `operator`\* | Specifies the kind of operator to be used. Options are:  * Field-aware operators: `exact_match`, `simple_search`, `undefined_match`, `double_range`, `date_range`, `datefragment_range`. * Logic operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. * Has operator: `has`. |
| operands | Specifies an entity as an input for a search term. Some operators allow for combining multiple operands. It is possible to define any nested conditional structures. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The different kinds of operators are complex and provide different optional configuration for refining them. We will go into detail of each operator in the [Tutorials > Query API > Discovering Queries](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_discovering_queries/index.html) task. |

See the following example for the `constraint` properties:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` "constraint":{     "operator":"and",     "operands":[         {             "operator":"exact_match",             "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/Nationality",             "value":"German"         },         {             "operator":"exact_match",             "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/LastName",             "value":"Baker"         },         {             "operator":"not",             "operand":{                 "operator":"exact_match",                 "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/Gender",                 "value":"MALE"             }         }     ] } ``` |
```

**Simplified logic**:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` Contact.Nationality == "German" ∧ Contact.LastName == "Baker" ∧ ¬Contact.Gender == "MALE" ``` |
```

In the example above, the query result entries are filtered by a combination of field-aware as well as logic operators.
Only those contact documents are selected, which are "German", with last name "Baker", and not male.

##### fields Parameter

The `fields` parameter is part of the projection for the query result. It allows to specify the data fields which should be returned.
All other Document Model fields will be ignored. Providing this parameter improves performance and reduces the result payload.

See the following example for the `fields` parameter:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` "fields":[     "/Contact/PersonalData/FirstName",     "/Contact/PersonalData/LastName" ] ``` |
```

In the example above, the query results are limited to include only the first and last name fields from the documents. All additional fields defined in the Document Model are systematically excluded from the returned data set.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This way also the metadata fields under the root group `__meta` will be excluded from the query result. If these are required for the response, the specific ones can be added to the `fields` array. |

##### links Parameter

The `links` parameter allows selecting additionally related documents in a relationship next to the query root documents.
It is possible to define constraints for the link documents, which allows the filtering of such.

Table 5. `links` Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `relationshipModel`\* | Specifies the Relationship Model, which document data shall be retrieved for. |
| `targetRole`\* | Specifies the target role in the relationship that will be linked to the root document. Data Services differentiates for document types "ROOT", "CHILD" and "LINK". |
| `constraint` | Defines a condition on the target document of the relationship, which allows for filtering of the link documents. |
| `linkDocumentConstraint` | Defines a condition on the link document, which allows for filtering the list of links. This is only allowed when a Link Document Model is defined for the relationship. |
| `fields` | Specifies which fields of the "CHILD" documents should be included in the query result. If not explicitly provided, all fields are included. |
| `linkDocumentFields` | Specifies which fields of the "LINK" documents should be included in the query result. If not explicitly provided, all fields are included. |
| `links` | Allows for linking additional documents to the link documents. It is possible to define either recursive or nested structures. |
| `maxDepth` | Relevant for self-referencing relationships. It is possible to query for such relationships. In these cases the `maxDepth` parameter has to be provided. This specifies how many of these references will be resolved. This parameter is required when a self-referencing relationship is detected in a link during the query validation. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

See the following example for the `links` parameter:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` "links":{     "relationshipModel":"CompanyContact",     "targetRole":"Company",     "fields":[         "/Company/GeneralInformation/CompanyName",         "/__meta/docRef"     ],     "constraint":{         "operator":"exact_match",         "field":"/Company/GeneralInformation/CompanyName",         "value":"Trading Good Ltd."     },     "linkDocumentFields":[         "/Root/Role",         "/__meta/docRef"     ],     "linkDocumentConstraint":{         "operator":"exact_match",         "field":"/Root/Role",         "value":"executive"     } } ``` |
```

In the example above, the link documents for the relationship `CompanyContact` are selected and filtered by the following criteria:

* The target document company name must be "Trading Good Ltd.".
* The "LINK" document role field must be "executive".
* The fields for the "CHILD" documents are limited to the company name and the document reference.
* The fields for the "LINK" documents are limited to the role and the document reference.

These documents will be added to the query result.

##### Aggregation Parameter

Table 6. `aggregation` Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aggregations`\* | List of different aggregation operations. |
| `function`\* | Specifies the type of operation, which should be processed. Options are "avg", "min", "max", "sum" and "count". |
| `field`\* | Specifies the Document Model field for which the aggregation should be processed or grouped. |
| `group`\* | Collect the aggregation results and group them based on a `field`. |

Legend
:   \* = Required parameter

See the following example for the `aggregation` parameter:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` "aggregation":{     "aggregations":[         {             "function":"count",             "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/FirstName"         }     ],     "group":[         {             "field":"/Contact/PersonalData/LastName"         }     ] } ``` |
```

In the example above, the contacts are counted and then grouped by the last name.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you have been introduced to the foundational concepts of the new Query API, including its core advantages and processing the first request.
The subsequent step will provide a comprehensive exploration of advanced query functionalities, delving deeper into the API’s sophisticated capabilities and operational mechanisms.

If something does not seem right, or you got stuck at any point, you can just check out **2025.06-ext5/query/task-1-end** to see differences between both implementations.
