# Introduction

## What you can find in this section

In this section of our user documentation, you can find general information which may be of interest to many different user types.

This document will give you an overview of A12, what it is, and how it works. This is a good place to start for a first introduction. If you are new to A12 and interested in learning more, keep reading to understand [What is A12?](#_what_is_a12)

To see an example of a full stack A12 application in action, you can [download the Modeling Environment installer](https://geta12.com/installer/) and open one of the sample workspaces in the Preview Application.

But first, an important question to answer …

## What is A12?

A12 is a platform for developing enterprise applications in complex IT landscapes. It relies on model-driven software engineering (MDSE) and brings the low-code principle to the world of enterprise software. As an open platform, A12 simplifies the integration of best-of-breed solutions and the use of AI at all levels. A12‘s Modeling Environment provides tools to create and maintain parts of an application over the long term as independent business logic modules without programming experience. A12‘s Runtime Platform provides the flexibility needed to evolve business-critical applications with professional individual software development, AI support and system integration into fully integrated enterprise applications.

## How A12 Works - From Models to Applications

A12 is a model-driven approach to business software. It provides a set of concepts, components and tools for creating modern, web applications.

### Decouple Domain-Specific Information From Development

The core idea of A12 is to encapsulate domain-specific knowledge in models. By using a set of powerful tools, domain experts and business analysts are able to create and modify these models - without the need to touch any code. This concept significantly reduces custom development efforts. Moreover, it enables domain experts to adapt their applications rapidly - which is a competitive factor in a digitized world with fast changing business requirements.

### Enable Cross-Platform and Cross-Device Applications

In terms of business applications, the client-side has gained the most traction during the last years. The needs to support mobile end devices like smartphones and tablets and to enable seamless workflows between different systems and platforms have introduced new levels of complexity. The A12 framework responds to these challenges by introducing flexible, light-weight UI-Engines implemented in JavaScript - coupled with a coherent concept for device-independent visual design and modern look and feel.

### Controllable Use of AI

Generative and agent-based artificial intelligence is increasingly finding its way into the software development process. In an enterprise context, however, approaches such as “vibe coding” should be treated with extreme caution. A12 and the specially developed tools for quality assurance, security testing, and build & deployment provide a controllable framework in which generative and agent-based AI systems can be used effectively and responsibly.
mgm has already begun to explore the possibilities. For example, a prototype integrated into the SME has already been developed that automatically generates initial models based on provided PDFs. Further forms of AI support are in the planning stage and will be gradually incorporated into the platform.

## How the A12 Platform Is Structured

![A12 Structure](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/what_is_a12/assets/A12_Structure.png)

From a conceptual point of view, A12 can be roughly divided into the following areas:

1. **A12 Modeling Environment:**

   The Modeling Environment provides several tools that can be used to represent high levels of business complexity for enterprise applications.
   You can learn more about it in the Modeling-section of the documentation.
   If you are a developer you should get at least a basic understanding of which types of models there are since these are the applications' parts that can be created and maintained without programming.
   If you are a business analyst, this is the core area of A12 which is relevant for you.
2. **A12 Design System Plasma:**

   Enterprise applications are characterized by high information density and great complexity.
   Design languages such as Material Design hit their limits quickly.
   They cannot fully respond to some challenges, such as how to present complex tables, clearly.
   Or how to develop the user interface structure consistently when new information is added.
   This is why mgm developed A12’s Plasma design system.
   Learn more about Plasma in the UI/UX section.
3. **A12 Runtime Platform:**

   The A12 runtime platform consists of a set of modular client and server side components in a modern enterprise architecture.
   It provides robust components for typical enterprise application requirements.
   At the same time, it gives the development team full control through fine-grained entry points to plug in their own code and implement individual project requirements.
   The development section contains everything you need to know as a developer – pointers for getting started, tutorials, detailed documentation of each component and instructions for migrating to the newest A12 Release Line.
4. **Containerization:**

   mgm relies on a series of standards for A12 projects that enable fast setup and automate essential build & deployment processes.
   These primarily include pre-built Helm charts and Jenkins pipelines.
   Learn more about it in the Build & Deployment section.
   It is mainly intended for DevOps users.
   In addition, there are cross-functional areas that extend across several of these areas.
   These primarily include quality assurance and security.

## Data First - The Modeling Philosophy of A12

**A12 is all about models. But what exactly can you model as a business expert? What are the benefits of having different models for data and the user interface? And how does A12 differ from other modeling approaches like GUI builders?**

The A12 platform enables experts and analysts to create and adapt business applications. It aims at building applications much faster than usual and allows for business-driven adjustments on the fly. This is accomplished in large parts thanks to a model-based approach. The platform provides tools for creating models. And it provides technical environments which interpret these models and use them to control what the corresponding applications are about. The first step of gaining a deeper understanding of this approach is to take a closer look at the models.

A guiding principle of the platform is to separate different kinds of models: data models and UI models. We decided to separate data and UI information from each other in order to introduce a higher level of flexibility and re-usability. You can create several different user interfaces, for example, which refer to the same data model.

### The Bedrock of Business Applications: Data and Validation Criteria

The first step of creating applications with the A12 platform involves the creation of so called Document Models. If you want to build an application for stock management, for example, you need a structural outline for articles among others. An article has a name, represented as a string. It has a serial number. It has a price. There has to be numbers which describe how many items of each article are in stock. Additionally, there are rules for the validity of data. The price cannot be negative. The serial number has to satisfy a certain format. All these organizational structures and criteria, which relate to the business perspective, are defined in an A12 Document Model. In more technical terms, Document Models contain specifications of fields, data types, type definitions, and validation rules.

[Document Modeling](#DocumentModeling) facilitates both the definition of data structures and validation rules. Data fields can be ordered in groups. For conveniently adding and modifying validation criteria, the editor features "autocomplete" and "syntax highlighting" for the [Kernel Language](#ValidationLanguage). In large applications, there might be large sets of data definitions and validation rules. That is why we introduced so-called "Includes": You can include Document Models in other Document Models. If you have a basic Document Model for articles, for example, you can reuse it in quite different contexts.

### Content-Related User Interface Design

The Simple Model Editor (SME) is the control center for modeling in A12. The tool enables business analysts and domain experts to design and test key parts of business applications themselves without any programming knowledge. It features visual perspectives as well as live previews and pursues a rather abstract but very powerful way of modeling user interfaces. Instead of diving too early into design-specifics like colors, margins and spacing, the editor focuses on the organization of UI elements via models. Instead of letting the user put input fields, radio buttons or text labels directly on screen in a WYSIWYG-style, it operates with hierarchical lists of model elements. This modeling philosophy enables business experts to focus on their domain and model complete user interfaces on their own. The graphical finish is completely decoupled and not specified in UI models like the Form Model. In order to provide an attractive and modern design out of the box, A12 makes use of Plasma Design - a coherent design concept for business applications developed by mgm.

Each A12 UI model refers to at least one A12 Document Model. This is a crucial aspect for understanding the design philosophy of the SME - and the main difference to classical GUI builders. Except from static content pages with the A12 CMS there is no point in creating UI models without corresponding Document Models. You can think of UI models as a kind of wrapper for selected parts of your Document Models. They provide the frame for user interaction based on a selection of your data fields. Due to this connection, the Document Model and its accompanying validation rules are usually created first. As soon as this has been done, new UI models with a reference to this Document Model can be created. Data and validation definitions really take the center stage in A12. It takes a little getting used to, but once you get the idea of this unique approach, you will surely appreciate how fast you can build robust and productive software with it.
