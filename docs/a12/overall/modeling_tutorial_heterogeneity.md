# Tutorial: Heterogeneity Modeling

## Prerequisites

The target audience for this tutorial are business analysts.
Some prior knowledge of the tools is assumed.
Before you start this tutorial, you should have completed the following training course(s) and tutorials.
For more details on what topics are covered, please follow the links.

* [A12 Fundamentals Training](https://geta12.com/#/trainings/training-ba-modeler#modeling-fundamentals-training)

This tutorial focuses on Heterogeneity and the relevant documentation is linked below.
Although the terminology used in this tutorial is explained in the documentation, we’ve included a glossary of terms to help you if you don’t understand what we are trying to say:

* [Modeling Heterogeneous Data documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/heterogeneity/index.html#Heterogeneity)
* [Heterogeneity Glossary](#Heterogeneity_Glossary)

This tutorial uses the [installer](https://geta12.com/installer/) which you can download from geta12.com.

## Use-case

I collect different personal information for employees, freelancers and interns working in my organization.
There is, however, some shared information as they are all people.
These data fields include their names and dates of birth.

As all these people work in my organization, I want to be able to group this information and view it in one overview.
However, I want to be able to add type-specific data fields and clearly separate the different categories so that I view them in three separate overviews if necessary.

Finally, as all the people working in my organization are employees, freelancers or interns you should not be able to add people without them being either an employee, freelancer or intern.

![Heterogeneity Schema](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Heterogeneity_Schema.png)

Figure 1. Use-case schema

## End Result

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to deploy your models so that you can:

* Add new instances of the employee, freelancer and intern Document Models as *Subtypes* of the people *Supertype*
* View employees, freelancers and interns together in the overview for people
* View employees, freelancers and interns in their own separate overviews

The end result will be similar to the People module of the advanced workspace.
If you need to check your work as you do the tutorial, please refer to the expandable sections at the end of each step:

You can find a list of models that you created as well as fullscreen pictures of each step to guide you.

## Essentials of Heterogeneity

You may have noticed some differences between the use-case and the end-result sections.
This is largely because the end result uses some specific terminology that you should understand when using Heterogeneity.
So, before we get started with the step-by-step modeling guide, let’s clear up any questions you might have about Heterogeneity.

### What Can I Do With Heterogeneity?

Heterogeneity allows data of different types to be grouped and listed together.
This group can then be treated in a unified way, for example, allowing data from the grouped types to be included in a single list.
In the use case, we want to group the different types of people working for our organization.

In the following, the terms type and Document Model are used synonymously.
However, they serve different purposes. Document Model is the well-known way in which the inner structure of documents are defined.
Type is used here to describe the semantic connections between entities without caring about their inner structure.

So far, when we create three separate Document Models for employees, freelancers and interns, we would view this data in three separate overviews.
By using heterogeneity, we can view the data from all three types in a single ***Heterogeneous List***.

The Document Models are grouped together using a ***Supertype*** Document Model.
The Document Models that should belong to this group are then added to a list of ***Subtype*** Document Models using an ***Annotation*** in the Document Model Settings.
This can be done in one of two ways:

* Set the *Annotation* "superTypes" in the *Subtypes* Document Models and add the name of the *Supertype* Document Model as the annotation value.
* Set the *Annotation* "subTypes" in the *Supertype* Document Model and list the *Subtype* Document Models in the annotation value.

Data from fields on the *Subtype* Document Model which have identical paths to fields on the *Supertype* Document Models can then be displayed in trees and overviews.
In the picture below, the fields "FirstName", "LastName", "DateOfBirth" and "Type" all have the same path on the *Supertype* People\_DM and *Subtypes* PeopleEmployee\_DM and PeopleFreelancer\_DM.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The path includes the name of the root group. That means, that the root groups of the *Subtype* and *Supertype* Document Models should have the same name. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The data from fields in the "UniqueData" groups will not be part of the *Heterogeneous List* as these fields are not present in the *Supertype*. |

![Text SharedFields](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_SharedFields.png)

Figure 2. Paths for Fields on the *Supertype* People\_DM and *Subtypes* PeopleEmployee\_DM and PeopleFreelancer\_DM

#### *abstract* *Supertypes*

An *Annotation* controls if the *Supertype* can be instantiated or not.
A *Supertype* that can not be instantiated is referred to as ***abstract*** and the user will not be able to select this type in the ***Variant Dialogue*** when adding new instances.
The *Heterogeneous List* is then only made up instances of the *Subtype* Document Models.

#### Using the *Supertype*

The *Supertype* Document Model can be used as reference for the Overview or Tree Models.
In overviews or trees, the data of the *Subtype* and *Supertype* documents are treated and displayed in the same way, as long as the paths to the fields match.
When a new document is created, the user will be able to choose the type of document.
In our use-case, this means that the user will be able to select if a document for an employee, freelancer or intern should be created.

*Supertype* Document Models can also be used in Relationship Models.
This means that any of the grouped documents may take the respective role when creating a new link.
For example, employees, freelancers and interns could be linked to a team using a single (heterogeneous) Relationship between the *Supertype* People and Team Document Model.

Finally, these groups of Document Models can also be again grouped together with another *Supertype* Document Model.
For example, we could group employees with short-term contracts and employees with rolling contracts, both having the employee Document Model as the *Supertype* (which has in turn the people Document Model as its *Supertype*).

### How Can I Apply Heterogeneity to Different Use-Cases?

The use-case will determine whether the *Supertype* should be *abstract*, and therefore not instantiated, or not.
In the use-case of this tutorial, employees, freelancers and interns are all *Subtypes* of the people *Supertype*.
And as all the people working in the organization are either employees, freelancers or interns, the *Supertype* will not be instantiated and therefore marked as *abstract*.

Other use-cases may require a general category, and the *Supertype* could be used to store the data that cannot be assigned to a specific *Subtype*.
The *Supertype* would then be set to *abstract* = false. This difference is represented visually in the picture below.
On the left-hand side we see the *Subtypes* of an *abstract* *Supertype*, there we have only employees, freelancers and interns.
On the right-hand side we see that the *Supertype* is not *abstract*, and instances of the people *Supertype* may be created.

![Text Use cases](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_Use_cases.png)

Figure 3. Effect of the *abstract* annotation. Left: The *Supertype* is abstract. Right: The *Supertype* is not abstract.

Using Heterogeneity with an Overview Model allows data of different types to be displayed together.
Heterogeneity can also be used in Relationship and Tree Models.
If the *Supertype* Document Model is referenced in the Relationship, then any instance of the *Subtypes* can be part of the links.
In Tree Models, the possibility to create a link to a new document can be restricted to certain types.
This is not possible in Form Model Bindings, where documents of all *Subtypes* are listed as *Available Items*.
In this example, only one Relationship Model between the person and team Document Models would be needed to create links between an employee (*Subtype*) and a team or a freelancer (*Subtype*) and a team.
This is investigated in more depth in the tutorial, [How to Put It Together](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/modeling_tutorial_super1/index.html).

### What Does Heterogeneity Look Like in the UI?

When a *Supertype* Document Model is referenced in an Overview Model, the information from all the respective documents is compiled together into a uniform list.
The field references for the columns are selected from the *Supertype* Document Model and the data of matching fields of the *Subtype* documents is then displayed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If the fields referenced in the Overview Model are not present in the *Subtype* Document Model (path must exactly match), the respective column for this document will be blank. This could lead to blank entries in the overview. |

#### The Variant Dialogue

When the user clicks on the modeled "Add" button in the overview, a dialogue opens to allow the user to choose the type of document that is to be created.
The user can then choose any of the document types in the group.
If there are groups within groups, these will be displayed in a tree structure in the *Variant Dialogue*.

If the top-level *Supertype* is abstract, it will not be shown in this dialogue.
Further *Supertypes* that are grouped by the top-level *Supertype* will be shown in the tree structure but may only be selected if they are not abstract.
Once the user makes a selection, the relevant form is opened to allow the user to enter data.

![Text Variant Select](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_Variant_Select.png)

Figure 4. Variant Dialogue

The same *Variant Dialogue* is used when creating new documents which are linked in a Composed Data Model, or when creating sibling or child nodes in a tree.

![Text Variant Select Tree](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_Variant_Select_Tree.png)

Figure 5. Variant Dialogue in a Tree

The buttons to add new documents may also be modeled separately in a Tree Model so the user may add one specific type of document.
Using the example from the use-case, this would mean that three separate buttons are modeled called "Add Employee", "Add Freelancer" and "Add Intern".
In this case, the *Subtype* Document Models are referenced and the *Variant Dialogue* is not shown.

#### Heterogeneity in Relationships

When a *Supertype* is used in one of the roles in a Relationship Model, the user is presented with a Heterogeneous List in the relationship UI component and may select any of the *Subtype* documents as well as the *Supertype* documents, in the case that the *Supertype* is not *abstract*.

### How Does Heterogeneity Compare to Other A12 Models?

Heterogeneity is a feature that is controlled using *Annotations*.
In other words, Heterogeneity is not a model, heterogeneity is a way of grouping data types, which allows data from instances of different Documents Models to be viewed in the UI in a heterogeneous overview.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Once the document type has been set, the user can not change the document type to a different type. |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Plan the Shared Data Fields

As already mentioned in ["What Can I Do With Heterogeneity?"](#What_can_I_do_Heterogeneity), it’s really important to plan the data structure of your models.
The path to shared data fields on the *Supertype* and *Subtype* Document Models must match exactly.
In other words, the shared fields need to have the same names and be in the same groups with the same structure.

Let’s start with the data structure that we’re planning to use.
We’re collecting personal data, so we can create a root group called "People".
We can then create two subgroups called "SharedData" and "UniqueData".
You don’t have to use this structure, but it will allow us to clearly see what we are doing as we work through this tutorial.
If we use the shared data from the use-case, then we should plan to model these data fields in the "SharedData" group.
We can also add an enumeration that we can use to show what type of person is being shown in the heterogeneous overview.
The planned structure looks like this:

* People (Group)

  + SharedData (Group)

    - FirstName (String)
    - LastName (String)
    - DateOfBirth (Date)
    - Type (Enumeration: Employee/Freelancer/Intern)
  + UniqueData (Group)

    - to be completed

According to the plan above, fields that are not present on all the variants should be added to the "UniqueData" group.
If you want to be able to view any of these fields in the heterogeneous overview, you must ensure that these fields are also included in the *Supertype* Document Model using the same data structure.

### Step 2: Model the Document Model for the *Supertype*

![Text 2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_2.png)

Figure 6. People\_DM

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You will need to spend some time modeling steps 2 and 3. |

As you can see from the schema in the use-case, employee, freelancer and intern Document Models are *Subtypes* of the people *Supertype*.
We’re going to start by modeling the Document Model for the *Supertype*: People\_DM.
For our use-case, we don’t need to add any UniqueData fields as we only want to display the Shared Data in the overview (Name and Date of Birth).

We can therefore model People\_DM using the following groups and fields that we planned in Step 1:

* People (group)

  + SharedData (group)

    - FirstName (string field)
    - LastName (string field)
    - DateOfBirth (date field)
    - Type (enumeration field Employee/Freelancer/Intern)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A simple strategy to ensure consistency in the SharedData group is to use an include. |

Let’s follow our own advice and use an include.

* Create a Document Model called SharedData\_DM.
* Model the SharedData Group on this model as planned.
* Model a Document Model called People\_DM.
* Add the Group, "People", and then include SharedData\_DM.

If you’re wondering why we don’t need a Form Model for People\_DM, the answer is simple.
We need a Document Model to act as the *Supertype,* but we don’t want to create *Supertype* documents and therefore don’t need a Form Model.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

People\_DM, SharedData\_DM

![Step 2 1 People](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_2_1_People.png)

Figure 7. People\_DM with included SharedData\_DM

![Step 2 2 SharedData](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_2_2_SharedData.png)

Figure 8. SharedData\_DM

### Step 3: Model the Document and Form Models for the *Subtypes*

![Text 3](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_3.png)

Figure 9. PeopleEmployee\_DM

The next step is to model the Document and Form Models for the three *Subtypes* that we have in the use-case.
The "Create Copy" feature in the Workspace Explorer is a great help at this point.
Not only do we save time, but we also create models with exactly the same field names and structure.
This ensures that the *Supertypes* and *Subtypes* will match exactly in terms of the paths to the fields used in a heterogeneous overview.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Copying a Document Model will copy any includes that you used as well. |

* Click on the context menu on the right-hand side of People\_DM in the Workspace Explorer.
* Select "Create Copy".
* Choose the folder and, as we’re going to start with the Document Model for employees, change the name to PeopleEmployee\_DM.
* Model the "UniqueData" group.
* Add the extra fields shown in the table below to this group.

We also need to model a computation rule that sets the enumeration field to the correct value.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Model Reference is saved in the metadata but using a Computation Rule allows you to model a localized value of your choice. |

* Model the computation in the "UniqueData" group.
* Select the computed field to be "Type" using the drop-down menu.
* Leave the precondition empty and set the calculation to "Employee".

Keep creating copies of the People\_DM model and adding the unique fields until you’ve completed the PeopleEmployee\_DM, PeopleFreelancer\_DM and PeopleIntern\_DM Document Models.
You should add a label under Model Settings to each Document Model as this will be used later to select the *Subtype* in the *Variant Dialogue*.

| Document Model | Field in UniqueData Group | Field Type | Label | Other Information |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PeopleEmployee\_DM | StartDate | Date | Start date |  |
|  | JobTitle | String | Job title |  |
|  | ProbationaryPeriod | Confirm | Probationary period complete |  |
|  | Salary | Number | Salary | Decimal places min and max = 2  Min Value = 0  Unit = Amount |
| PeopleFreelancer\_DM | Company | String | Company |  |
|  | DailyRate | Number | Daily rate | Decimal places min and max = 2  Min Value = 0  Unit = Amount |
| PeopleIntern\_DM | StartDate | Date | Start date |  |
|  | EndDate | Date | End date |  |
|  | Supervisor | String | Supervisor |  |

* Create the Form Models for these Document Models as normal.
* Don’t forget to set the amount suffix to "€" and to add save and cancel buttons at the bottom!

As mentioned in [Step 1](#HeteroStep1), if we want to be able to view any of these fields in the heterogeneous overview, then they also need to be added to the *Supertype* Document Model using the same data structure.
If, for example, the start date of employees should be shown in the overview, then the field "StartDate" should also be added to the "UniqueData" group on the *Supertype* Document Model.
The StartDate of interns would be shown in this column as well, but it would be always blank for freelancers.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

PeopleEmployee\_DM, PeopleFreelancer\_DM, PeopleIntern\_DM PeopleEmployee\_FM, PeopleFreelancer\_FM and PeopleIntern\_FM

![Step 3 1 Employee](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_3_1_Employee.png)

### Step 4: Add the Annotations to the *Supertype* Document Model

![Text 4](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_4.png)

Figure 16. Annotations in Model Settings of People\_DM

To link the *Supertype* with its *Subtypes* we need to add an annotation to the People\_DM Document Model.
We also want to ensure that no documents of the People\_DM Document Model can be created.
To ensure this we need to set the *Annotation* "abstract" = "true" for People\_DM.

* Go to the Simple Model Editor and select People\_DM.
* Use the sidebar on the left to open the Model Settings.
* Click on "Add" under the Annotations section.
* Add the *Annotations* shown in the table below.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| subTypes | PeopleEmployee\_DM,PeopleFreelancer\_DM,PeopleIntern\_DM |
| abstract | true |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is important that you do not add any spaces in this list of *Subtypes*. The *Subtypes* must be separated by a comma only, no spaces. |

* Click on "Apply" in the bottom right-hand corner.
* Save your model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you want to create *Supertype* documents, set the *abstract* annotation to "false". Don’t forget that you’ll need to create a Form Model for the *Supertype* Document Model. |

As discussed in ["What Can I Do With Heterogeneity?"](#What_can_I_do_Heterogeneity), the *Annotation* "superTypes" may be used to group Document Models by adding a list of *Supertype* Document Models in the Document Model Settings of the respective *Subtype* Document Model.
If you prefer to follow this methodology, remove the "subTypes" *Annotation* from People\_DM and add the "superTypes" *Annotation* to PeopleEmployee\_DM, PeopleFreelancer\_DM and PeopleIntern\_DM instead.
The value you need to enter is "People\_DM".
It is also possible to mix these *Annotations* and the same result may still be achieved.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

No new models were created.
Annotations were added to People\_DM.

![Step 4 Annotations](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_4_Annotations.png)

Figure 17. Annotations on People\_DM

### Step 5: Create the Overview Models

Before we can finish, we need to create an Overview Model to show the heterogeneous data of employees, freelancers and interns together.
We also wanted to see the data separately, so we’re going to add an overview for the employees too.
If you want to, please feel free to add overviews for the freelancers and interns too!

##### Create People Overview

![Text 5a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_5a.png)

Figure 18. People\_OM

* Click on "ADD" in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Overview Model".
* Complete the Folder, Name, Locales and Roles and click "OK".
* Select People\_DM from the Document Model drop-down.
* Add the columns that reference the shared data that we chose in [Step 1](#HeteroStep1).
* Click on the add button in the columns section and choose an element reference from the drop-down menu.
* Enter a name and label for the column, click apply and move on to the next column.

| Column Label (automatically taken from Field label) | Element Reference |
| --- | --- |
| First Name | /People/SharedData/FirstName |
| Last Name | /People/SharedData/LastName |
| Type | /People/SharedData/Type |

If you have chosen to include an extra field that is only present on one (or more) *Subtype\_* Document Models you can add this now.
In [Step 3](#HeteroStep3), we discussed the option to add the "StartDate" field to the "UniqueData" group on the *Supertype* Document Model.
If you did this, you just need to create an extra "Start Date" column and choose the correct element reference (/People/UniqueData/StartDate).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can only select fields that have been modeled on the *Supertype* Document Model in the "Element Reference" drop-down menu. |

Once you have added the columns we need to add buttons to the overview.

* Switch to the Custom Actions tab.
* Add a delete row action.
* Add button to the minor subheader section.
* Save the Overview Model.

##### Create Employee Overview

![Text 5b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_5b.png)

Figure 19. PeopleEmployee\_OM

To be able to see the data from the employee *Subtype* separately, we need to repeat the process for the employee overview.
There are no differences between setting up the standard overview for the employees and the heterogeneous overview for the people.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you prefer to use separate buttons to add the individual variants, then you need to ask your developer to help you. Once these buttons have been set up, they can be modeled in the subheader section of the people overview, too. |

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

People\_OM, PeopleEmployee\_OM

![Step 5 1 People Overview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_5_1_People_Overview.png)

Figure 21. PeopleEmployee\_OM

### Step 6: Use Master Detail Module Models to Create the Modules

![Text 6a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Text_6a.png)

Figure 22. People\_MDM

You’re now ready to add each Overview Model to a new module.

* Click on "ADD" in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Master Detail Module Model".
* Complete the Folder, Name, Locales and Roles and click "OK".
* Use the drop-down menu to select the Overview Model we just created in [Step 5](#HeteroStep5).
* The Document Models are already added to the Form Mapping section.
  Simply select the correct Form Model from the drop-down menu for each Document Model.
* You also need to navigate to the Model Settings tab and enter a label in the Main Menu Label section.

Apart from the additional form mapping options, there are no differences between setting up the models for employees and people.
The Master Detail Module Models can now be added to the App Model.

* Click on the PreviewApp\_AM and navigate to the Model Settings tab.
* Click on the Add button in the Model References section at the bottom.
* Select "module-masterdetail" and the People\_MDM model that we just created using the two drop down menus.
* Click on the add button again to add the PeopleEmployee\_MDM.
* Save the model and you’re finished!

You can now test your models to make sure that everything is working perfectly.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

People\_MDM, PeopleEmployee\_MDM

![Step 6 1 People MDM](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_heterogeneity/assets/Step_6_1_People_MDM.png)

Figure 23. People\_MDM

Figure 25. Reference MDMs in PreviewApp\_AM

## How to Test and Troubleshoot Your Models

* Start your workspace using the Preview App Control and log in (admin:a12).
* Connect the Simple Model Editor to the server using the "Configure Server Connection" button in the top right-hand corner of the Simple Model Editor (admin:a12).
* Deploy your workspace and refresh your browser tab.

Now you can navigate to the People module that you added in [Step 6](#HeteroStep6).
The model will have the label that you added to the Main Menu Label section of the Model Settings Tab in the Master Detail Module Model.
In this module you can add documents of the three *Subtypes* by clicking on the add button that you added to the custom actions of the Overview Model.

However, with the add button in the employee module, only documents of the *Subtype* employee (PeopleEmployee\_DM) can be created.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | All the employee documents are listed in the employee overview that you added in [Step 6](#HeteroStep6). Freelancer and intern documents will not be shown in the employee overview. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you want to retain this test data, you can save it in your Workspace by clicking on the "Replace Workspace Data" button in the Workspace Explorer of the Simple Model Editor.  Check the [Simple Model Editor documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-ba-docs/index.html) for more information. |

### Troubleshooting

1. If you don’t see any labels in the "Please select variant" dialogue, you need to update your Document Models:

## Glossary

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | An *abstract* Document Model cannot be instantiated and so the user cannot create new instances of this Document Model. This is controlled using annotations which can be set in the model settings of the *supertype* Document Model. This annotation can take the value *true* or *false*. When creating a new document in a heterogeneous context, such an abstract supertype (abstract = *true*) will not be offered in the variant dialogue. When no annotation is added the default behavior is that the supertype will be offered (abstract = *false*). |
| **Annotations** | An annotation is a name-value pair that can be added to the model in the model settings and all model elements. The application that uses the Document Model can access those annotations and can use them within custom implementation, e.g. to show all fields that have an annotation in bold face.  In the model settings, at least one annotation is set which contains the roles for this model. The relevant annotations for heterogeneity are *subTypes*, *superTypes* and *abstract*. |
| **Heterogeneity** | This is the principle that allows data of different types to be used in a unified way. This allows, for example, data of different types to be shown in the same list. In A12, this means that it is possible to model overviews that contain lists of heterogeneous data. |
| **Heterogeneous Overview** | This is the type of overview used to display different types to be shown in the same list. When the user chooses to add a new item to a heterogeneous overview, they must select which type of item they wish to add and should then be presented with the appropriate form to complete. For all fields that we intend to display in a heterogeneous overview, it is necessary that the path to those fields in the Document Models is identical. |
| **Path** | The path shows the data structure and provides part of the identity.  In A12 we model paths when we create groups in the Document Model. If we create a root group "root" and another group within this group, "subgroup", then the path to a field, "string\_field" in "subgroup" would be: `/root/subgroup/string_field`. |
| **Subtype** | A *Subtype* is one of the different data types which are grouped by the *Supertype*. In A12, it is an additional Document Model which is linked to a *Supertype* by an *Annotation*. The data from *Subtype* models can then be used as part of a heterogeneous overview. When creating a new document in a heterogeneous context a choice of all the *Subtypes* (and possibly the *Supertype*) will be offered.  The *Subtype* Document Models contain some or all of the fields that can be found in the *Supertype* Document Model. Please ensure that the path to those fields in the Document Model is identical. Other fields may exist in the *Subtype* Document Models but these will not be displayed in the heterogeneous overview. |
| **Supertype** | The *Supertype* is used to group types of data and use it in a unified way. In A12 the *Supertype* is a Document Model (or sometimes a set of models) and the *Annotation* "subTypes" is used to show which Document Models should be grouped under the *Supertype*. The *Supertype* can then, for example, be referenced in an Overview Model so that the heterogeneous list of data can be viewed. If a *Supertype* is marked as *abstract* it will not be instantiated and as a result will not be offered when creating a new document in a heterogeneous context. |
| **Variant** | A variant is a *Supertype* or *Subtype* which is offered to the user when creating documents in a heterogeneous overview. For example, if a *Supertype* (*abstract* = *false*) has two *Subtypes*, then three variants will be offered. |
