# Accessing A12 Artifacts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This setup is only for mgm partners who do not have access to the mgm artifactory. The setup for mgmies can be found in the [documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/project_template/project-template-documentation/index.html#_artifactory_internal_developers) of the Project Template. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The audience of this chapter is developers. |

This chapter describes the necessary setup for getting access to our A12 artifacts. The following sections describe the two scenarios for this. If you already operate your own proxy for artifacts, then please read on with [Access via Proxy](#access-via-proxy). Otherwise, please continue with [Direct Access](#direct-access).

## Dual Licensing and Related Authentication

A12 is offered in [two editions - Community and Enterprise](https://geta12.com/#/editions-licensing). Access to the artifacts differs between the two editions, and details are described in the [Direct Access](#direct-access) section.

## Access via Proxy

### npm

Set up your own npm registry to proxy `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-community-npm/`, and `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-enterprise-npm/` if you are an enterprise user.

Please refer to the documentation of the used registry for more details on how to set up a proxy.

### Maven

Set up your own Maven repository to proxy `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-maven/`, and `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-maven/` if you are an enterprise user.

**Additional required repositories:**

* <https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public>
* <https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases>

Please refer to the documentation of the used repository for more details on how to set up a proxy.

### Docker

Set up your own Docker registry to proxy `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-docker/`, and `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-docker/` if you are an enterprise user.

Please refer to the documentation of the used registry for more details on how to set up a proxy.

### Helm

Set up your own Helm registry to proxy `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-helm/`, and `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-helm/` if you are an enterprise user.

Please refer to the documentation of the used registry for more details on how to set up a proxy.

## Direct Access

### Community Users

Community artifacts are accessible without authentication. You only need to set up the following registries in your build tools.

#### npm

In order to get access to the community npm artifacts of A12, it is required to extend your [.npmrc](#community-npmrc).
(Please read the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/npmrc) for more details.)

|  | The '**~**' (tilde) symbol marks a relative path to the user’s home directory. It is mostly used for Unix-like systems, but works in Windows as well via PowerShell.  It would typically be `/home/username`, `/Users/username` or `C:\Users\username`, depending on the used OS. |

For the `.npmrc`, you can use the following template:

~/.npmrc

```

```

#### Maven

Add `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-maven/` to your Maven or Gradle settings.
Please read the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html) or
[Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html) for more details.

**Additional required repositories:**

* <https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public>
* <https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases>

In the end, your [repositories.gradle](#community-repositories.gradle) file should look like the following:

~/.gradle/init.d/repositories.gradle

```
settingsEvaluated { settings ->
    settings.pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            exclusiveContent {
                forRepository {
                    maven {
                        name "mgmart"
                        url 'https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-maven/'
                    }
                }
                filter {
                    includeGroupByRegex "com\\.mgmtp\\.a12.*"
                }
            }
            maven {
                url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
            }
        }
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        exclusiveContent {
            forRepository {
                maven {
                    name "mgmart"
                    url 'https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-maven/'
                }
            }
            filter {
                includeGroupByRegex "com\\.mgmtp\\.a12.*"
            }
        }
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases/"
        }
    }
}
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If the `init.d` folder doesn’t exist, it has to be created. |

#### Docker

The community Docker registry is accessible right away. You can test access by pulling the images by following:

```
docker pull <image>:<tag>
```

#### Helm

Add `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-helm/` to your Helm repositories:

```
helm repo add <repo-name> https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-community-helm/
helm search repo <repo-name>
```

### Enterprise Users

Access to the enterprise artifacts is restricted by authentication.

#### GetA12 Artifactory Account

Your GetA12 credentials, used for accessing this documentation, should also be valid for the GetA12 Artifactory. If you do not have access, please reach out to your project lead or the [Partner Management Team](mailto:partnermanagement@mgm-tp.com) to request the access.

##### Technical User

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To retrieve the enterprise artifacts using automation tools or CI/CD pipelines, you must use a **technical user** along with a valid **identity token** generated from GetA12 Artifactory. |

If you are an enterprise user and your project does not have a technical user account yet, please request it from the [Partner Management Team](mailto:partnermanagement@mgm-tp.com).

#### Identity Token

You will need to create an identity token for build tools that require Artifactory access by following these steps:

1. Login to [Artifactory (mgm partners only)](https://artifacts.geta12.com/) with your getA12 credentials, or project technical user’s credentials.
2. Open your profile in the top-right corner, and click `Edit Profile`.
3. In `Authentication Settings` click on `Generate an Identity Token`.
4. Add a Description, e.g., "Build Tools".
5. Copy the token and use it for the tool configuration.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The token is not stored in the Artifactory, so make sure you copied it **before closing the window** with the token string. |

#### npm

In order to get access to the enterprise npm artifacts of A12, it is required to extend your [.npmrc](#enterprise-npmrc).
(Please read the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/npmrc) for more details.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The '**~**' (tilde) symbol marks a relative path to the user’s home directory. It is mostly used for Unix-like systems, but works in Windows as well via PowerShell.  It would typically be `/home/username`, `/Users/username` or `C:\Users\username`, depending on the used OS. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure to use your [identity token](#_identity_token), **not the GetA12 password**. Using the password will lead to a locked account after a few trials. |

Once you have created the identity token, you need to add it to your `.npmrc` along with your email and Artifactory username. For the `.npmrc`, you can use the following template:

~/.npmrc

```
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

//artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-enterprise-npm/:_authToken = <IDENTITY TOKEN>
//artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-enterprise-npm/:always-auth = true
//artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-enterprise-npm/:email = <EMAIL>

@com.mgmtp.a12.querymodel:registry=https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/api/npm/a12-enterprise-npm/
```

#### Maven

You have to define the two following properties in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

~/.gradle/gradle.properties

```
repository_username: <This is your email>
repository_password: <This is your identity token>
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure to use your [identity token](#_identity_token), **not the GetA12 password**. Using the password will lead to a locked account after a few trials. |

Add `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-maven/` to your Maven or Gradle settings.
Please read the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html) or
[Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html) for more details.

**Additional required repositories:**

|  | If the `init.d` folder doesn’t exist, it has to be created. |

#### Docker

Authenticate to `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-docker/` by using:

```
docker login artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-docker/ -u <username>
```

If the `docker login` asks for a password, you have to enter your [identity token](#_identity_token).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure to use your [identity token](#_identity_token), **not the GetA12 password**. Using the password will lead to a locked account after a few trials. |

Then you can pull the images by following:

```
docker pull <image>:<tag>
```

#### Helm

Add `https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-helm/` to your Helm repositories:

```
helm repo add <repo-name> https://artifacts.geta12.com/artifactory/a12-enterprise-helm/ --username <username>
helm search repo <repo-name>
```

If the `helm add repo` asks for a password, you have to enter your [identity token](#_identity_token).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure to use your [identity token](#_identity_token), **not the GetA12 password**. Using the password will lead to a locked account after a few trials. |
