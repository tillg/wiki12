# How We Handle Breaking Changes

Developers, modelers and end users rely on the **stability** of the A12 platform, while it evolves, in particular on the level of public programming **API**, **configuration**, **modeling**, documented functional **behavior** and **appearance** (detailed definition follows below).

Changes in these areas require the attention of project teams when upgrading to a newer A12 release, and might force projects to adapt, e.g. by changing code or configuration followed by quality assurance, or by explaining a change to their customer.
Any change with such an **upgrade impact** is called a **breaking change**.

## How We Do It

### Justification

Why are we doing this change in a breaking way?
Since breaking changes will lead to effort in other components and projects, we should always have a good and documented reason, e.g. changes in architecture, alignment of API patterns, new regulation (e.g. for accessibility), better maintainability.

### Management

We make sure that every change is assessed whether it is breaking or not.
In the first step we **try to avoid** the breaking change by finding an alternative approach that can be realized in a non-breaking way.
If this is not possible or if there are still good reasons to do it in a breaking way, then the change is **planned for a major release** (see also [A12 Versioning Schema](https://geta12.com/#/releases/policies)).
**Minor releases** and **patch releases** are defined as **backward-compatible**, i.e. they do not contain breaking changes.
Using [**deprecation**](https://geta12.com/#/releases/policies) is an approach to grant projects more flexibility in planning their migration.

### Explanation

Any *breaking change* or *deprecation* requires the following information:

* **What** has changed?
* **Why** was it changed this way?
* **How to adapt** to it?

  + Is there a *strict need to adapt*, e.g. because programming API was changed and customer project code will be broken?
  + Is there an *optional need to adapt*, e.g. if behavior or appearance has changed, which could be accepted?

### Exceptions

No rule without exceptions: there are rare cases, which force us to deliver breaking changes in minor or patch release. This can happen due to

* necessary security fixes,
* breaking changes introduced by 3rd party dependencies,
* own bugfixing.

If this happens, then we communicate it explicitly along with the release and we provide all other usual information for breaking changes, e.g. migration instructions.

New components or features are sometimes introduced as experimental and later stabilized and then productive.
Experimental code is marked as such (directly in code structures, in containing modules and/or in documentation) and is sometimes changed in a breaking way in minor or patch releases.

## General Definition

### Breaking Changes

* Compilation fails
* Code adaption is required
* Manual model adaption is required
* Configuration adaption is required
* Infrastructure adaption is required
* Project needs additional effort to restore previous UI, UX (appearance, interaction).
* Only happen in major releases (see also [A12 Versioning Schema](https://geta12.com/#/releases/policies))
* Migration instructions are provided explaining what, why and how to react

  + This is also done for breaking change in exceptional cases or experimental code appearing in minor or patch releases

### Non-Breaking Changes

* A12 model migration tool is provided doing the full job without any further interaction by modelers
* Happen in any release including major, minor and patches releases
* Deprecated code or information will be marked and migration instructions are provided

### Public API vs. Internal Code

On code level, we distinguish between documented public API and internal code.
Internal code is not exported or marked as such by "internal" in naming of artifacts, folders, files, paths, packages, types, methods or in code level documentation.

Breaking change management is applied to public API only, changes to internal code can happen any time without notice.

### In Detail

| Breaking | Non-Breaking |
| --- | --- |
| **Public API** | |
| * Remove public API * Change the signature of public API incompatibly  + Remove parameter   + Change sequence of parameter   + Change parameter types   + Change return type * Add public signature in an implementable interface without default implementation | * Add public signature with default implementation * Change public signature compatibly  + Add optional parameter * Add public signature in an interface for usage only |
| **Behavior** | |
| * Remove public behavior * Change public behavior | * Add public behavior |
| **Internal Code** | |
| * Change internal code with effect on documented behavior | * Change internal code without effect on documented behavior |
| **Configuration** | |
| * Add mandatory configuration * Rename configuration * Remove configuration * Change the default value * Change meaning or behavior of configuration | * Add new mandatory configuration key with a default value that maintains existing behavior * Add optional configurations keys or values * Add new value to existing configuration |
| **Dependencies** | |
| * Upgrade to new major A12 dependencies * Upgrade to new major 3rd party dependencies | * Update to new minor or patch versions of A12 dependencies * Update to new minor or patch versions of 3rd party dependencies * Remove obsolete dependency |
| **Model and Modeling** | |
| The following points are breaking changes, but they are usually covered fully by automated model migration scripts, and then they do NOT count as breaking: \* Change the structure of a model type \* Add mandatory elements \* Add mandatory properties \* Remove elements \* Remove element properties \* Rename elements \* Rename element properties | * Add optional elements * Add optional properties * Increase model version covered by model migration * Change modeling tools (in a way that does not impact the resulting models) |
| **Localization** | |
| * Add a localization key for a non-optional feature * Change a localization key * Change the usage of a localization key * Change the localized text in a way that changes meaning | * Add a localization key for an optional feature * Remove a localization key * Change the localized text slightly |
| **Data Representation** | |
| * Change leads to incompatible data * Change requires data migration | * Change does not impact data compatibility * Change does not require data migration |
| **Performance** | |
| * Significant performance degradation | * Significant performance improvements that are otherwise non-breaking |

## Frontend Specific Aspects

Frontend specific aspects on top of the general ones above:

| Breaking | Non-Breaking |
| --- | --- |
| **Public API** | |
| * Change / removal of the ID attribute generated by UI engines * Change / removal of the following attributes in generated HTML:  + data-role   + label   + aria-label   + title   + placeholder   + aria-selected   + aria-checked   + aria-expanded   + aria-sort   + contenteditable   + hidden-text * Removal/rename of a theming variable | * Add public behavior  + could lead to compatible change of models * Change of internal processing * Change in HTML structure  + e.g. changing the relative location of data-role to interactive elements  - i.e. the relative location is internal, just like the HTML structure * Adding id, data-role, title, label, aria-label, placeholder, hidden-text in generated HTML * Change of CSS classes |
| **Appearance** | |
| * Change appearance with impact on behavior | * Change appearance without impact on behavior |
| **Dependencies** | |
| * TypeScript: Use of types or language constructs that are incompatible to the communicated TypeScript version of the release line  + i.e. usage of new types from newer TypeScript versions in public API that lead to compile errors with the TypeScript version of the release line | * TypeScript: Use of types or language constructs that are compatible to the communicated TypeScript version of the release line  + i.e. usage of new functionality from newer TypeScript versions in public API that still compiles with the TypeScript version of the release line |

### Considerations about HTML and CSS being *internal*

Some projects raised concerns about HTML and CSS structures being *internal*.

Since we want to limit the amount of breaking change and manage the necessary change properly, the evolution of A12 Widgets would significantly slow down and require a lot more effort.
Therefore, we are interested in keeping HTML and CSS internal.
With the following agreement, we acknowledge the needs of the projects.

#### Re Automated Testing

##### Data-role (and other attribution like title, label, aria-label)

In A12-based web applications, we use a custom web resolver to support automated UI testing with QF-Test. This resolver extracts specific HTML attributes and enables stable component recognition, resulting in robust and maintainable test automation.

The resolver operates as follows:

1. **data-role Attribute**
   This is the primary attribute used to determine the QF-Test class of a UI element, such as TextField, Panel, TextArea, Label, etc. It defines the functional type of the element and is critical for proper mapping.
2. **label**
   If present, the label attribute is used to identify the UI element together with its class. It usually reflects the user-facing description or name shown next to the component in the UI.
3. **Fallback Attributes**
   If no label is found, the resolver attempts to use the following attributes in order of priority to help identify the element:

   * aria-label
   * title
   * placeholder
4. **Status Attributes**
   Following attributes are used for status checks f.g. table column sorting, table row selected, section expanded or collapsed, content editable

   * aria-checked
   * aria-selected
   * aria-expanded
   * aria-sort
   * contenteditable

These attributes are essential to retrieve status or descriptive metadata about UI elements and support unique or at least more accurate identification, especially in complex UIs.

IDs or specific attributes in this sense are in the first place supported by widgets, which provides methods to set the ID and guarantee that the appearance of the ID in the HTML markup is stable. Engines use this widget API and set IDs or attributes that are usually bound to their model - they keep also this stable.

However, based on our experience, relying on HTML IDs for test automation has proven to be unsustainable. IDs are often fragile, prone to change during development or refactoring, and require significant maintenance effort to keep test cases stable. Therefore, our long-term goal is to phase out the use of HTML IDs for component recognition in favor of more robust and semantically meaningful attributes. This strategy allows us to build more resilient and maintainable automated test cases, while maintaining the flexibility required to adapt to frequent UI changes.

#### Re Styling

##### Theming

Widgets defines and implement a theming concept based on an structure of variables. (<https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/basics/theme/theming>)
They define a set of fundamental default and semantic aspects in variables, e.g. base font, color palette or styling for selection, focus, hover, destruction, etc.
These variables are public API and changing values here enables you to adjust certain aspects of the appearance consistently and easily.

If you miss a feature here - let’s get in touch.

##### Customizing CSS

Adding custom CSS on top of everything is of course technically possible, and it might be required sometimes, e.g. to have a temporary solution until A12 has improved theming capabilities.

Since we do not apply breaking change management on HTML and CSS level, there is a risk that an A12 upgrade breaks your custom styling.
Therefore, if you do it, please keep track of such cases, so that you can do focused regression tests after the upgrade. See <https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/get-started/use-and-configure-widgets-style>, section Global style override (NOT RECOMMENDED).

##### Customizing Markup

Various widgets provide extension points to inject custom render code, e.g. the Table widgets allows to hook in custom code to render the header.

These extension points are public API and there to enable you in a reliable way.
The responsibility for the extension is of course on project side.

##### Custom Widgets

A12 widgets are React components - you can combine A12 widgets with your own widgets or with 3rd party React components.

In many cases you might create higher level custom widgets from lower level A12 widgets - this is an intended approach and if you run into problems, e.g. styling side effects within A12 widgets due to particular combinations, please let us know.

##### Theming for Custom Markup and Custom Widgets

To align the styling of custom extensions or own widgets, you might want to hook into the theming concept.
E.g. if your custom widget has a notion of “selection”, then you can use styling aspects, which are defined in a semantic way with theming variables.
More concretely: you can e.g. use the selection color variable provided there.

Since the theming variables are public API, this is a valid approach.
Doing so enables your project to evolve your theme easier and makes your custom widget also a hotter candidate to become an A12 widget.
