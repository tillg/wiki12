# Relationship Modeling

This document serves as an introduction to A12 Relationships.

The target audience for this documentation is the business analyst. Some prior knowledge of the tools is assumed.

In the following chapters, you can find out about the properties maintained in a Relationship Model, how Relationships are displayed and in what ways they currently differ from repeats.
Frequently used terms can be found in a Glossary. Please also refer to our tutorial for [Relationship Modeling](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/index.html) and learn how to link documents and why you might need to use relationships in your project in a step-by-step guide.

It is also possible to use Heterogeneity in Relationships. For details, refer to the documentation for [Modeling Heterogeneous Data](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/heterogeneity/index.html).

If you are a developer wishing to include Relationships in your A12 project, please also refer to the sections covering Relationships in the [Client documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_relationships) and the [Data Services documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#relationships). The installer Preview App comes with Relationships already set up but the Project Template does not. So if your project is based on the Project Template, or if you have not already enabled your project to include Relationships, you will need to follow the Client and Data Services documentation linked above.

## The Relationship Model and its Properties

In A12 we have the possibility to express the connection between entities with ***Relationships***.
An example could be a company’s organisational structure: There are many persons (employees) and many teams.
The persons may work for one or several different teams in different positions and for different time spans.
One larger team could also contain subteams.

A12 Relationships introduce another model: the Relationship Model, in which a connection between two Document Models can be specified.

A Relationship Model is a data model and as such, can be compared to a Document Model.
While the Document Model speaks of fields and rules, the Relationship Model speaks of roles and link constraints.
In the example above, there would be the Document Models *Team\_DM* and *Person\_DM*, a Relationship Model could describe the connection between them.

An instance of a Document Model is called a document.
In the example, there could be documents representing teams T1 and T2, and persons P1, P2 and P3.
An instance of a Relationship Model is called a link.
A link in the example above could represent a concrete connection between team T1 and person P1, team T2 and person P2 and team T2 and person P3.

### Related Document Models

A Relationship Model always connects two Document Models (entities) with each other. The connection does not have a direction.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Document Models that should be connected via a Relationship must possess only one root group each. |

Each Document Model takes up a ***Role*** in a Relationship. A Document Model in a certain Relationship is then referred to by its Role.

For each Role, the number of allowed links needs to be specified: the multiplicity, a link constraint. It is the maximum number of instances of this Role that can be linked to one instance of the other Role. If there is no limit, the multiplicity is called unbounded.

In the team-person example above: A person can be part of one but also several teams, and a team can have many people.

* the allowed number of instances of the Role *Team* to be linked to one instance of the Role *Person* is not limited → multiplicity for the Role *Team* is unbounded → "One person can be a member of many teams."
* the allowed number of instances of the Role *Person* that can be linked to one instance of the Role *Team* is not limited → multiplicity for the Role *Person* is unbounded → "One team can consist of many persons."
* this results in a team:person Relationship of *n:n*, where n is "unbounded".

Find more examples in the chapter [Common Relationship Types](#relationship_types).

### Link Document Model and Duplicate Links Allowed

In case of an n:n Relationship, it is possible to maintain additional information. This information can be different for each link.
The information is stored in so-called ***Additional Link Fields*** which are modeled in a separate ***Link Document Model***.
There are no constraints towards the amount or types of fields that can be used as Additional Link Fields.
In the example mentioned above, the additional information could be the *Position*, *StartDate* and *EndDate* for each team-person link.

If the checkbox "Duplicable" is checked, the end user can create multiple links between the same two documents.
Additional Link Fields can then be used to distinguish the different links.
This would be used in the example: A person can leave a team at a specific time (*EndDate*), but rejoin the same team later (with a different *Position*). Please be aware that the content of possible Additional Link Documents is not validated in terms of uniqueness across multiple links.

The Link Document Model reference and the checkbox "Duplicable" are only active for n:n Relationships.
The Relationship Model Editor shows a warning if a 1:n or 1:1 Relationship Model has a Link Document Model or Duplicable set.
There are two possibilities to resolve this issue depending on the business case:

1. The business case requires that the multiplicity of one role equals 1: The field(s) that were modeled in the Link Document Model should be transferred to the Document Model of the Role with multiplicity >1. This can easily be achieved by including or inserting the fields of the Link Document Model. (To remove the Link Document Model reference in the Relationship Model, set both multiplicities temporarily to >1.)
2. The business case requires that data is saved in Additional Link Fields: This is an indicator that the multiplicity constraints should be defined as >1 for both roles.

### Link Order

It needs to be specified if links of one instance of a Role to instances of the other Role can be ordered by the user.
By default, the setting Orderable is disabled and the links are always indexed in ascending order by their creation time, i.e. the newest links are displayed at the bottom of a list in the UI and the oldest are displayed at the top.
If the setting Orderable is enabled for the role, it can be set by a developer whether newly created links shall be placed on the top or bottom of the respective list. Furthermore, if the child role of a relationship that is used in a tree model is set to Orderable, the order of siblings of the same parent can be changed via drag & drop.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Manual ordering of links is only possible if the Relationship is displayed in a Tree Engine. A Relationship Model with Orderable Roles will not enable manual ordering in a Dual Pane Selection or Table List in a Binding. However, a user determined order maintained in a tree will also be displayed in a Dual Pane Selection or Table List for the same Relationship and Role. |

## Modeling a Relationship Model

This section will only cover modeling the Relationship Model itself. In order to use a Relationship in your application, several different models are needed. An overview and step-by-step guide is given in [the Modeling Relationships tutorial](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/index.html).

Relationship Models can be modeled in the Simple Model Editor (SME). If you want to create a new Relationship Model, you can do so via the "Add" dialogue in the SME:

![add relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/add_relationship.png)

Then, a modal will be displayed in which you need to add meta information for your Relationship Model:

![new relationship model dialogue](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/new_relationship_model_dialogue.png)

The folder in which the model is stored depends on your project’s settings. If you use the installer Preview App you can store the Relationship Model in the "models" folder of the workspace.

Model name, locales and roles depend on your project. The model name needs to be unique in your workspace.

### Relationship Model Editor

The newly created Relationship Model is now opened in the Relationship Model Editor. The meta information given before can be found and changed in the tab "Model Settings".

![RME Model Settings](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/RME_Model_Settings.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The labels which can be maintained for the Relationship Model are currently not used in the default UI for Relationships. |

![RME empty](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/RME_empty.jpg)

In the tab "Relationship", the "Related Entities" as well as additional information can be maintained.
Via the "Add" button it is possible to add exactly two entities and define the Document Model and Role. Furthermore, link constraints as well as labels are maintained here.

![Entity RME](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/Entity_RME.jpg)

The labels will be displayed above the Relationship UI components in Form Model Bindings. They are optional.

For each Role, the number of allowed links, the multiplicity, can be set in the section "Link Constraints". The "Upper Limit" specifies the maximum number of instances of this Role that can be linked to one instance of the other Role. If there is no limit, the multiplicity is "Unbounded".

In case of an n:n Relationship, a reference to a Link Document Model can be chosen and it can be selected, whether links between the same two documents are allowed. ([See example below.](#link_field))

![RME](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/RME.jpg)

### Generated Document Models

Relationships require a special set of Document Models, the *generated Document Models*. They can be generated in the SME using the button "Generate Document Models" in the footer of the Relationship Model Editor. When using this button, two Document Models will be created in the folder you selected, one for each Role of the Relationship. An export is triggered as well. The generated Document Models abide by the naming convention *RelationshipName\_Role\_\_\_\_generated*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Do not change the name or content of the generated Document Models. |

The generated Document Models will later be used as reference in the Overview Models intended for a UI element (Binding) displaying the linked documents in a form.
If a Link Document Model is referenced, it will be included in the generated Document Models.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The roles assigned to the generated Document Models are calculated by performing an intersection over the roles defined in the Relationship Model and all related entity Document models, including the optional link Document Model.  As a result of this intersection, some roles may be omitted from the generated Document Models. It can cause runtime issues, as authorization checks may fail when required roles are missing, therefore please ensure that all related models define the necessary overlapping roles before generating Document Models. |

## Common Relationship Types

When talking about Relationships, you might encounter different types that commonly occur: *1:n* Relationships, *n:n* Relationships and self-referencing Relationships.
You can find examples for these Relationship types below along with an example of how to use Additional Link Fields.

### Linking two different Document Models

#### *1:n* Relationship

A *1:n* Relationship is a Relationship in which one Role has the upper limit of 1 as multiplicity, while the other Role has a multiplicity >1 or an unbounded multiplicity.

An example would be a yearly report for a person: Person (*1*) - Report (*n*).
The report is only about/from one specific person, but each person can be subject of/create many reports.
Properties, like *DateSubmitted*, that you might associate with the Relationship, would be modeled into *Report\_DM*.

![relshtype 1 n person report](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/relshtype_1_n_person_report.png)

Figure 1. 1:n Relationship

#### *n:n* Relationship

An *n:n* Relationship is a Relationship in which each Role has a multiplicity >1 or an unbounded multiplicity.
An example would be a team-person Relationship: each team can contain several persons and each person can be part of several teams.

![relshtype n n team person withoutLinkfields](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/relshtype_n_n_team_person_withoutLinkfields.png)

Figure 2. n:n Relationship

### Additional Link Fields

As mentioned [above](#relationships_link_doc), additional information about the link can be stored in ***Additional Link Fields***.
This is optional. The additional information is modeled as fields in the Link Document Model. It can contain as many fields as you like.
For the example Relationship TeamPerson, the Additional Link Fields could be *Position*, *StartDate*, *EndDate*.

![relshtype n n team person withLinkfields](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/relshtype_n_n_team_person_withLinkfields.png)

Figure 3. n:n Relationship with Additional Link Fields

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In the example above, the last person has two links to the same team. This could represent different timeframes (*StartDate*, *EndDate*) or *Positions*. Whether two links between the same documents are allowed or not, is controlled with the "Duplicable" setting. |

### Self-Referencing Relationship

In a self-referencing Relationship, both Roles are taken up by the same Document Model, thus making it possible to create links between instances of one Document Model.
They can be *1:n* or *n:n* Relationships.

An example for a *1:n* self-referencing Relationship would be a Relationship between teams and subteams: each team can have several subteams, but each subteam has only one parent-team.

![relshtype 1 n selfref team team](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/relshtype_1_n_selfref_team_team.png)

Figure 4. self-referencing Relationship

### Many Relationships in One Domain

One Document Model can be part of several Relationships. Person\_DM is part of the Relationships TeamPerson and PersonReport.
Moreover, the same two entities can be connected by multiple Relationships. For example, instead of one PersonReport Relationship, there could be two: ReviewerReport and RevieweeReport. Those can have different properties. While there is only one reviewee per report, there could be many reviewers per report.

![MultipleRelationshipsBetweenSameDMs](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/MultipleRelationshipsBetweenSameDMs.png)

Figure 5. Multiple Relationships between same entities

All the example Relationships are shown schematically in the tree below, there are *1:n* Relationships TeamReport, RevieweeReport and ReviewerReport, a self-referencing *1:n* Relationship TeamTeam and an *n:n* Relationship with Additional Link Fields TeamPerson.

![Types of relationships hierarchical](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/Types_of_relationships_hierarchical.png)

Figure 6. Many Relationships displayed in a tree

## How we Display Relationships in A12

In A12 there are a number of UI elements called ***Relationship UI Components*** available which can be used to display the links between entities:

* in the Form Engine as Drop Down Selection, Dual Pane Selection or Table List (Bindings)
* in the Tree Engine as an hierarchical display with additional means to edit and create new links and linked documents

### Form Engine

A relationship can be displayed in the Form Engine by a ***Binding***.
For more details, please refer to the [Binding Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-binding-ba-docs/index.html).

### Tree Engine

The Tree Engine can be used to display and edit links as well.
A tree is always hierarchical: the two Roles of a Relationship need to be divided into **parent** and **child**.
It is possible to display several Relationships in one tree, as long as they all descend directly or indirectly from the same Document Model parent.
A Role of this Document Model does then take up the **root** of the tree.
For more details, please refer to the [Tree Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/index.html#_the_tree_model).

#### User Determined Order of Links

Selecting "User Determined Order" for a Role means that links to this Role can be ordered manually in regards to their siblings.

Ordering links by the user is currently only possible in the Tree Engine.
Drag and drop needs to be enabled in the corresponding Tree Model.
However, the user determined order will also be shown in the Bindings in the Form Engine.

## Differences Between a Relationship and a Repeat

Sometimes it can be difficult to understand why a modeler would choose to use a Repeat to display their data or whether it would make more sense to model Relationships. The table below describes the differences between data in Repeats and Relationships.

Table 1. Repeat vs Relationships


|  | **Repeat** | **Relationship** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | Data in Repeats is fully owned by the document that it appears in. If the document is deleted, the data in the Repeat is deleted with all other data on the form. | Relationship links cannot currently be owned. The related documents continue to exist even if a parent document is deleted. Ownership is planned for future releases of Relationships and is already in specification. |
| Modeling | Simple modeling - Modeled as a repeatable group in the Document Model, selected fields from the group are added to the Repeat in the Form Model Editor of the SME | Complex modeling – several Document Models, Form Models, Overview Models and a Relationship Model are necessary. There is a complex process which must be followed to add a Relationship. |
| Engines | Form engine | Form Engine, Relationship Engine, Tree Engine, Overview Engine |
| Interaction patterns | Three types of Repeats are available in the Form Engine:  * Inline * Detached * Embedded | Linked documents can currently be maintained in a *Drop Down Selection* (for single selection/to-1 Relationship), a *Dual Pane Selection* or shown in a *Table List* (for multiple selection/to-many Relationship). |
| Creation of children | Can create children in the Repeat | There is a requirement to allow creation of document and linking in one step but currently you cannot create a child in the Bindings. The user can only add a link to an existing document. The Tree Engine embedded in a master/detail context with a Form Engine allows creating and linking in one step already. |
| Validation & Computation | Validations and computations are possible within the scope of a single Document Model, i.e. with Repeats in a Form Engine. | Validation or computation across Relationships/links is not possible. |
| Data persistence | Repeats are part of the form | Instances of Relationships are links between documents |
| Life cycle | Repeats are a part of a Form Model | Relationships can be modeled to link entities in an application. Related Document Models can have their own life cycle, their own workflow, contain unlimited fields including repeat data, have multiple Relationships and exist in an application independently of the Relationships that they are part of. |
| Workflows | Repeats can be used in Workflows | Workflows currently do not support Relationships |
| Heterogeneity/Abstractness | Repeats do not support Heterogeneity | Abstract Supertypes are possible in heterogeneous Relationships. Super/Sub-Types can exist without Relationships, but Relationships support Heterogeneity by allowing Relationships to point to Supertypes. |
| Orderability | Data in Repeats can be ordered | Links can be ordered when displayed in a Tree Engine |

## Simple Composed Data

*Composed Data* is a feature which enables the usage of fields of several Document Models in the same engine.
Those Document Models need to be connected via Relationships.

The current implementation is called "Simple" because it provides a limited subset of Composed Data functionality.
It includes ***Composed Document Models***, short CDM, and enables CDM based forms in which all fields of that CDM can be displayed and edited, although they stem from different Document Models and are persisted in different documents.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Simple Composed Data is an experimental feature. |

Simple Composed Data combines known Relationship UI elements (Bindings) like Table List, Dual Pane Selection and Drop Down Selection with the possibility to display and edit fields from related documents in one form.
Moreover, CDMs can be enriched with rules and computations that can make use of the whole CDM data context.

The starting point of CDM modeling is its root Document Model, which is determined by the business use case.

Regarding the company example sketched above, one could formulate the following business requirements:

1. When adding a person to a team, additional information is collected (*Position*, *StartDate*, *EndDate*, *TimeShare*) and it is ensured that there is exactly one person with *Position* "Team Lead" in the team.
2. On the team form, it is displayed how much *WorkCapacity* the team currently holds. This is calculated as the sum of the contribution of all current members. The individual contribution is the *WeeklyWorkhours* of each person times the *TimeShare*.

In these requirements, the team is the common bracket around all the linked persons and the corresponding Additional Link Fields, hence, Team\_DM would be the root Document Model of the CDM.
It is recommended to use a speaking name for the CDM, stating either the Document Models involved or the purpose of the CDM ([Model Naming Conventions](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/model_naming_conventions/index.html)).

Only Document Models that are connected directly or indirectly via Relationships can be included into a CDM.
There should be a (chain of) Relationships between the root Document Model and the included child Document Models.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The example discussed in this documentation is also modeled in the advanced workspace of the A12 installer. In `People > Persons with Contracts and Teams` and `Teams > Teams with Persons` you can find modeled examples for complex Computation and Validation Rules, Child Activities and Heterogeneity on root and child level. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please be aware, that the use of Relationship Models with Multiplicity "unbounded" in combination with CDMs pose a security risk. The Multiplicity in the Relationship Model should be lowered to a number reasonable in the project’s context. It is not sufficient to just lower the repeatability of the Relationship Element in the CDM.  **CDMs should NOT be used with Relationship Models with any Role having Multiplicity "unbounded"**. |

### Modeling a Composed Document Model

#### Example

To demonstrate all current features of CDMs, we add heterogeneity to the example above: persons in the company can either be an employee or a freelancer.
Moreover, a Contract\_DM is added, which holds a *StartDate* and *EndDate* as well as the *WeeklyWorkhours*.

![CDM relationship overview](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_relationship_overview.png)

Figure 7. Model Graph Diagram of the example use case

The goal is to create a Composed Document Model with Team\_DM as root, in which fields from Person\_DM and Contract\_DM will be displayed and editable.
It shall also contain fields of the Link Documents and check the following business requirements:

1. When saving the form for a team, there is exactly one person with *Position* "Team Lead" in the team.
2. When adding a new team member, it is displayed how much *WorkCapacity* the team currently holds. This is calculated as the sum of the contribution of all current members. The individual contribution is the *WeeklyWorkhours* of each person times the *TimeShare*.

#### Creation of the CDM

The SME contains a dedicated CDM Editor. See its [documentation here](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html#cdm_editor).

The manual creation with the Document Model Editor is described herein. Click to expand the explanation.

To create the CDM structure manually, follow these steps:

1. **Set the CDM Annotation**

   A CDM is created by adding a new Document Model and assigning the root Document Model via the following annotation in the CDM’s model settings:

   | Name | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | cdm.queryRoot | {root document model name} |

   ![CDM annotation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_annotation.png)

   Figure 8. Annotation in the CDM’s Document Model Settings
2. **Include root Document Model**

   The root Document Model needs to be included on root level of the CDM.
   The name of the include must exactly match the name of the root group in the included Document Model.
   In the CDM context, this include has a special name: ***Document Model Element***.

   ![CDM root include](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_root_include.png)

   Figure 9. Root Document Model included on root level in the CDM
3. **Build the structure of the CDM**

   The Relationships, that connect the Document Models of interest, determine the structure of the CDM.
   For each Relationship that is traversed, a subgroup is added.
   This nesting group structure must match the "path" of the Relationship connection.

   The Relationship that is represented by the group and the direction it is traversed, is determined by the following annotations to the group. The group is called ***Relationship Element***.

   | Name | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | cdm.relationship | {name of the Relationship that is represented by the group} |
   | cdm.targetDocumentModel | {name of the Document Model that is to be included} |
   | cdm.targetRole | {Role of the Document Model, that is to be included, within the Relationship} |
   | cdm.sourceRole | {the other Role in the Relationship} |

   ![CDM group annotations v2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_group_annotations_v2.png)

   Figure 10. Annotations for Relationship Elements

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | The Document Model Editor automatically creates the required annotations upon saving the CDM, if the `cdm.queryRoot`-annotation is set and the name of the group matches the Relationship’s name as seen in the SME Workspace Explorer. If a new nested Relationship Element is added after saving, the annotations of the parent Relationship Element must be removed. The SME does not traverse groups/Relationship Elements that have annotations already. |

   The Relationship Element’s repeatability must match the multiplicity of the Target Role. If "Unbounded" is selected in the Relationship, choose a reasonably high number. Otherwise, enter the respective Upper Limit.

   ![CDM structureSecondRelationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_structureSecondRelationship.png)

   Figure 11. Structure of the CDM and corresponding Relationships
4. **Include the Child Document Model**

   Each Relationship Element should contain the respective Document Model as an include.
   The include’s name must match the name of the root group of the included Document Model.
   In the CDM context, this include has a special name: ***Document Model Element***.
5. **Include the Link Document Model**

   Add a new subgroup `relationship` to the Relationship Element and add an include of the Link Document Model into this new group.
   Make sure that the name of the include is exactly the name of the root group in the Link Document Model.
6. **Result**

   ![cdm teamCDMinDME](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/cdm_teamCDMinDME.png)

   Figure 12. CDM structure as shown in the Document Model Editor to fulfill the example business requirements

The structure of the CDM for the example above is shown in the following figure.
It is based on Team\_DM as common bracket. The Relationship TeamPerson is followed to hold the links to the selected team members (Person\_DM). For each link, Additional Link Fields are stored and can be accessed via the included TeamPerson\_LinkFields\_DM.
For each person/team member, all linked contracts are obtained, by following Relationship PersonContract.

![cdm teamCDMinCDME](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/cdm_teamCDMinCDME.png)

Figure 13. CDM structure as shown in the CDM Editor to fulfill the example business requirements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Once created, the annotations and the repeatability of the Relationship Elements will not be refactored automatically. If the Relationship’s name or the Roles or Multiplicities are changed, the annotations must be adapted manually. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In the running application, the data of the CDM is handled with respect to the Document Models of its parts (the root and child documents), so that the parts can be persisted correctly on the server when saving "the CDM document". Consequently, all Document Models of those parts must be present at runtime.  The loading of all the needed models is done automatically, if the CDM is build with the editor using Includes.  But if a Document Model Element is not an Include, then the needed models must be added to the respective VIEW\_ADD directive in the App Model. If the Document Model Element refers to a heterogeneous SuperType, ensure that all the SubTypes are listed as well. |

#### Additional fields in the CDM

The purpose of a CDM is the connection of data from different documents.
Therefore, it is possible to add any number of fields, validation rules and computations to the Composed Document Model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Data changes in a CDM are **ONLY** persisted if the respective field is within the root, a child or an Additional Link Fields Document Model. Please make it clear to the end user, that the changes are done on the corresponding **document**; the changes are not specific to the individual CDM context. If the result of a computation rule should be persisted, the computed field must be within the root, a child or an Additional Link Fields Document Model.  Please be aware, that validation and computation rules, are **NOT** evaluated when the respective documents are edited outside the CDM based form. So make sure, that the end user can not change data relevant to the computation rules outside a CDM with the respective rules. Alternatively, speak to a developer to handle the CDM re-evaluation in the backend. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If data is computed in the CDM context, but should be displayed in the Bindings (referenced in the Binding Overview Models), the respective field must be modeled in the corresponding child Document Model. It should be transient.  For example: The team member list should show the individual time contributions of each member to the team’s *WorkCapacity*. The computation is modeled as child of the Relationship Element TeamPerson. The computed field is *WorkCapacityContribution*, a transient field modeled in Person\_DM. The value of the field is calculated when opening the CDM form or editing/adding links.  cdm TableviewWithCalculatedValue  Figure 14. List of team members with individual contribution to the team’s work capacity |

#### How to Determine, Whether a Link Is Established

In order to determine, whether a link has been established and a child document is present in the respective repetition, a technical field can be used. This field will only be filled when a link is created and a child document is present.
Add a string field with name `t_docRef` into the Relationship Element as a sibling to the Document Model Element.
As this is a technical field, it should not be added to UI Models.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This is a Client feature only. Do not use it in Computation Rules for fields that are executed on server side, e.g. to show on a CDD overview. A Rule `NumberOfTeamMembers = NumberOfFilledFields(/TeamPerson*/t_docRef)` will always show '0' in the CDD overview after (re)calculation on server side. |

However, it can be used to ensure that computed data is not written into fields that are not persisted (no document present).
Moreover, fields of to-1 related documents should only be shown to the user, if a link is established. (Otherwise the data entered is lost.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In order to hide fields, a Dependency must be set in the Form Model. For this, a suitable Trigger field must be available in the CDM. Use the `t_docRef` field to compute an additional transient boolean field which can then act as a trigger field. Use "FieldFilled(t\_docRef)" and "FieldNotFilled(t\_docRef)" in the computation. |

#### Heterogeneity on root level

Heterogeneity is supported on root level of CDMs.
This means, that the CDM can be based on a Document Model that is a Supertype.
This does **not** mean, that a CDM itself can be heterogeneous.

The concept and the modeling are similar to regular Document Models.
It is recommended to read the [Heterogeneity BA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/heterogeneity/index.html) first.

Consider the following business requirement:
For HR, an overview of all persons is needed, that shows *First Name* and *Last Name* (Person\_DM), the *StartDate* (Contract\_DM) of the latest contract and the number of current team assignments (using *StartDate* / *EndDate*) and the sum of the currently assigned *TimeShare* (TeamPerson\_LinkFields\_DM) for each person. When clicking on an entry, all fields of the respective Subtype (PersonEmployee\_DM or PersonFreelancer\_DM) should be shown together with the contract information.

To achieve an overview of all persons (employees and freelancers combined), the Overview Model must be based on the Supertype Person\_DM.
Since data of the linked contract document(s) should be shown as well, a CDM is needed. Its root is Person\_DM.
There is only one Relationship between the Supertype Person\_DM and Contract\_DM.
There must not be a Relationship between PersonEmployee\_DM and Contract\_DM / PersonFreelancer\_DM and Contract\_DM!

In order to show all fields of the Subtypes, two distinct forms are needed. If contract data should be shown as well, a CDM is needed.
These CDMs have the Subtypes as root Document Model:

* PersonEmployeeWithTeamsAndContracts\_CDM is based on PersonEmployee\_DM; a form based on this CDM is opened when an employee is selected in the overview
* PersonFreelancerWithTeamsAndContracts\_CDM is based on PersonFreelancer\_DM; a form based on this CDM is opened when a freelancer is selected in the overview

The computations to determine the latest contract’s *StartDate* and the number and sum of *TimeShare* of the current team assignments must be modeled in all three CDMs and maintained manually.

#### Heterogeneity on child level

The linked child documents can be heterogeneous.
As there is currently no way to restrict the selection to or filter for specific subtypes, the CDM Document Model Elements must always include the respective Supertype.

For example in TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM, the Document Model Element, that is placed within Relationship Element TeamPerson, should always include Person\_DM and not PersonEmployee\_DM or PersonFreelancer\_DM.

As a consequence, only the fields of the Supertype can be used in CDM computations or validation rules.
The respective [DetailScreen](#detailscreen_to_many) is also modeled only on the Supertype.
Use [Child Activity](#ca_to_many) to model a different form for each Subtype.

### Modeling a Form Model for a CDM

#### Fields of the root Document Model

The fields of the root Document Model can be treated in the Form Model Editor of the SME as any other field in a "normal" Document Model.

#### Linking and Modifying child documents

The link to child documents is established in UI elements called ***Binding***.
For general information about Bindings see the [Binding Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-binding-ba-docs/index.html).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | CDM-Bindings can only be created in the Form Model Editor by dragging dropping a Relationship Model Element onto a Screen or Section. It can not be created from the context menu. |

Depending on the multiplicity of the Target Role (the possible number of child documents), the modeling slightly differs:

##### To-1 Binding Component

If the multiplicity of the Target Role is 1, only one document can be linked.
This link should be maintained in the Binding component *Drop Down Selection*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The modeler must ensure that all links have a display text. In the Drop Down Selection a placeholer "NO LABEL" is shown to assist with debugging and to indicate a modeling issue. |

There are two options to model input fields for the linked document:

* Only allow selection and de-selection of an existing document via the dropdown.

  All fields of the child Document Model can be used in the Form Model as usual.
  Make a clear distinction for the user, which fields belong to which data context/document.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | The fields should not be available for input, if no document is selected/no link is established. In order to hide those fields, use the Dependent Control feature together with a [trigger field based on t\_docRef](#cdm_tdocref). |
* Enable Add and Edit by ticking the "Use CDM child activities" checkbox in the Binding Editor.

  This will activate the CDM Child Activity feature that is explained in the following [section](#child_activity_link).
  The user is then presented with a new form, in which the created/linked document can be edited.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | When launching the child activity, the original CDM context is left. While the new form shown to the user can again be based on a CDM, the rules and computations of the parent CDM will **NOT** be applied in the child activity. They will be applied, when the user leaves the child activity and returns into the parent activity. |

##### To-many Binding Component

If the multiplicity of the Target Role is > 1, many documents can be linked to the root/parent document.
These links should be maintained in a *Dual Pane Selection*.
But to have a better overview of existing links and to enable the user to see and edit the data of the child documents, a *Table List* must be used. Both UI components can be combined.

In Table Lists it is possible to create and link a new child document in one step.
The respective button is shown to the user when "Repeat Entries > Add" is checked in the Binding Editor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Additional Link Fields can currently not be entered in a modal right away when linking a document. Hence, there is no selection for an Additional Link Fields Form Model in the CDM Binding Editor. |

There are two options to model input fields for the linked documents.
The respective action is triggered if the user clicks on a row in the Table List.

* DetailScreen of the Binding

  When adding a Binding in the Form Model Editor via Drag&Drop, a *DetailScreen* is automatically created.
  All fields that are modeled within the corresponding Relationship Element can be used on that screen.
  This includes Additional Link Fields and fields defined in the CDM.
  Make sure the user can easily distinguish which fields belong into which data context.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | The "bread crumbs" of the DetailScreen are determined by the label set in the Binding Editor. The label above the Relationship UI element is determined by the label set for the Relationship Target Role. |

  It is also possible to nest another Binding onto that screen and traverse the next Relationship included in the CDM.
* CDM Child Activity

  Tick the "Use CDM child activities" checkbox in the Binding Editor.
  In this case, the DetailScreen is ignored and a Child Activity is launched. The modeling of a Child Activity is explained [below](#child_activity_link).
  This option will display the linked document in a dependant activity within its own form.
  This allows to edit fields defined in heterogeneous Subtypes, as there can be one form for each Subtype.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | To edit the Additional Link Fields, create a CDM for the child Document Model and include the Relationship and the Additional Link Fields Document Model there.  Example:  If the end user opens a form for Team\_CDM and clicks on a row in the Table List for TeamPerson, a new activity is launched and the user is presented with a form for the selected person. This second form can be based on a CDM (e.g. TeamMember\_CDM) that includes the Relationship TeamPerson. During runtime, this Relationship Element of TeamMember\_CDM will always be populated with **only one** link: the one to the root document of the CDM of the parent activity. In this example, the team edited in the original CDM form. Other teams, this person is linked to, will not be shown/available!  Due to this feature, the repeatability of the Relationship Element TeamPerson in TeamMember\_CDM can be set to 1 in the Details Editor of the CDM Editor, regardless of the Multiplicity set in the TeamPerson Relationship. This makes the modeling of the respective form straightforward.  But take care to not use TeamMember\_CDM in any other context. (If it was used together with an overview on Person\_DM in a Master/Detail Module, and any person be selected, the team context would not be present. The application would fetch **all** links and try to list all teams, the person is linked to. This would lead to an error.) |

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | When launching the Child Activity, the original CDM context is left. While the form shown to the user can again be based on a CDM, the rules and computations of the parent CDM will **NOT** be applied in the child activity. They will be applied, when the user leaves the child activity and returns into the parent activity. |

##### CDM Child Activities

If "Use CDM Child Activity" is activated in the Binding configuration, the linked document will be created or edited in a dependent activity with an own Form and Document Model.
That means, a separate form will be opened next to the CDM form, in which the created/linked child document can be edited.
An additional Scene in the App Model is required.
It must match the state of this new, separate activity as described in [the following section](#appmodel_link).

In case of a Drop Down Selection, the "Use CDM Child Activity" is activated by default to allow adding new entities. The Add / Edit button label can be configured. (If no link is established yet, the Add button is shown, otherwise the Edit button is shown, but never both.)

In case of a Table List, an Add button below the table can be configured. (Edit is triggered by clicking on the respective row.)

If the user clicks any of these buttons, the new activity will be created and the respective UI for that activity will be shown next to the original CDM form.

In case the CDM child is a Supertype, the *Variant Dialogue* is shown in order to determine the concrete type of the to be created document.

This new activity can again be based on a CDM, which essentially allows nesting of CDM activities of arbitrary depth.
Furthermore, different Document Models or CDMs can be used for the Child Activity in case of Heterogeneity.
This would then require different Form Models for each of the relevant Subtypes.

The Client provides a default data handling between the parent and Child Activity.
This must be enabled by setting the scene matching to `derive activity descriptor from parent scene` in the Binding editor.
Otherwise, the handling of the resulting data of the Child Activity has to be provided by custom implementation.

If `derive activity descriptor from parent scene` is chosen, the scene for the Child Activity can reuse some of the match conditions of the parent scene. Only `model` and `instance` will be adapted according to the Document Model and id of the document.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To ensure that data, that might have been changed in the parent activity, is also present in the Child Activity (and *vice versa*), the Child Activity works on a portion of the exact same data as the parent activity. That means, that if `derive activity descriptor from parent scene` is selected, no new data is loaded for the Child Activity. This applies also to links and linked documents.  Moreover, Bindings are only supported, if the Document Model that is the basis for the Child Activity is also a CDM. If no Bindings are needed, the Child Activity can use a regular Document and Form Model.  Consequently, only data that fits into the data structure of the CDM in the parent scene will be saved. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The feature described above can be used to hand down data, that was computed in the parent activity. For example in the team-person-contract context, the current *WeeklyWorkhours* of each team member would be computed in the parent TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM. This value can then also be used in the Child Activity, even if there is no respective computation in TeamMember\_CDM. Neither must it include the PersonContract Relationship.  Use this, to keep copies of complex computations low, but make sure that the values are used only as read-only. |

#### Initial Values and Rows

It is possible to define initial values and rows in Form Models based on Composed Document Models as with usual Form Models.

But there is one exception, where initial values cannot be set:

* In the chain of Relationships that connects the root Document Model to the Document Model that contains the field in question, the Target Roles must not contain Heterogeneity.

When providing initial values for fields of to-1 related Document Models, this leads to the automatic creation of **new** sub documents and links when creating a new document or when entering a respective detail screen. It is not possible to create new links to existing documents via initial values.

#### Dependencies using 'Not Relevant'

Field and Group Dependencies with *Not Relevant* are supported in CDM based Form Models and CDM Child Activities.
It is also possible to remove links on save, when a Relationship Model Element was marked as *Not Relevant* by a dependency.

However, at the moment there is the limitation that the relationship UI components (e.g. Table List) do not hide entities that are marked as *Not Relevant*. In such case, the whole Binding should be hidden by using the Dependent Control setting in the Form Model.

#### Controls with Index

Using Controls with index is currently not supported in Form Models based on Composed Document Models.

### Modeling an Overview Model for a CDM

CDMs can be used as basis for Overview Models.
Any Field defined within the CDM can be used.
Regarding Computed Fields, please see the section [below](#computedFieldsInCDMOverviews).

Most aspects of Overview Modeling with CDMs are exactly the same as "normal" Overview Modeling.
Refer to the [Overview Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-om-ba-docs/index.html) for further details.

There is a difference when it comes to optimizing the loading performance of overviews:
In case of the "normal" overview, per default, only the data that is needed for the overview is transmitted to the client.
No extra modeling is required.
This optimization is not done for the CDM overview.

In order to improve the loading performance of CDM overviews, modelers can do the following:

1. Create a dedicated CDM for the overview

   The CDM that is used for the overview and the CDM that is used for the corresponding Form Scene in a Master/Detail setting can be different.
   Just reference them correctly in the Overview and Form Model, no extra App Model settings are needed.
   It is possible to use a Master Detail Module Model.

   Reduce the amount of data that is loaded by only adding those Relationship Elements to the CDM that are needed for the overview.
2. Set the Annotation `indexed` = `false` in the Document Model on those Fields that are not shown in an overview

   Set the Annotation `indexed` = `false` on Fields that are not shown in an overview (as reference column or in an Expression).
   The Annotation must be set in the respective root or child Document Model, not in the CDM.

   Be careful with Fields used in Computations, please see the section [below](#computedFieldsInCDMOverviews).

#### Computed Fields in CDM Overviews

For "normal" Document Models, Computations are only executed

1. on saving a document
2. on loading a document in a form, if specified in the Form Model.

Computations are not automatically executed for the overview.

In contrast, it is possible to automatically execute all Computations of the CDM again when opening the overview.
A respective Data Services configuration flag must be set to activate this feature.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This setting has been made in the Preview App for all models. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | All Computations seen in the CDM are executed, not just those defined in the CDM. Use the `Exclude Computation Rules` setting in the Document Model Element Editor of the CDM to exclude the Computation Rules of the root or child Document Models. |

The Computations are executed at the time when Data Services composes the result that is sent to the client and shown in the overview.
This happens after the respective documents are gathered according to the Search term or Filters applied in the overview.

In order to prevent inconsistencies, take the following steps:

1. Remove the possibility for the enduser to Search or Filter on Fields that are computed by Computations defined in the CDM.

   If a Field of the root or a child document is computed by a CDM Computation and not shown in an overview or tree, then

   1. set the Annotation `indexed` = `false` on the Field in its Document Model to exclude it from the Search.
   2. Remove those computed Fields from the Filter list of the Overview Model for the CDM.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | If the enduser would filter on a computed Field of the CDM, they would never find an item, as this Field is always still empty when the Filter is evaluated.  If the enduser would filter on a Field of the root or child document, that is computed by a Computation of the CDM, the Filter would work on the value that was present when the document was saved. If the Computation then changes the result afterwards, this **could** lead to a difference between the value shown in the overview and the value defined in the Filter. It would seem as if the Filter would not work correctly. |
2. Columns that reference computed Fields should not be marked as sortable.
3. None of the Fields that are used in a Computation, which result is shown in the overview, should have Annotation `indexed` = `false`.

   This applies for all Fields referenced in the Preconditions and Calculations.

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | Fields with `indexed` = `false` appear empty to Computations, so the results shown in the overview and in the form (which has all data present) might differ without any error or warning.  There is modeling support that reports an error if a Field with `indexed` = `false` is used in an overview, but no support regarding the use in Computations. |

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | You can set the Annotation `indexed` = `false` on Fields in the CDM. This has no consequence on the performance, but you can benefit from subsequent modeling support and prevent "accidental" usage of a computed Field in an overview. |

### CDMs and Regular Overviews or Trees

CDM based overviews and forms can be combined seamlessly with regular tree, overviews or forms.
It is possible to show a regular form for an entry of a CDM based overview in a Master/Detail layout or to show a CDM based form for an entry in a tree.

### CDMs and Master Detail Module Model

CDM based Overview Models can be selected in the Master Detail Module Editor.

Moreover, CDM based forms can be used in the Detail activity.
The Client will detect, if a form is based on a CDM and will activate the special CDM data handling automatically.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The current implementation of the Master Detail Module Model does not support CDM Child Activities. It can only be used with [DetailScreens](#detailscreen_to_many). |

### Setup in the App Model

To use CDMs in an application, certain settings have to be made by a developer.
If this is covered, it is possible for a modeler to add a CDM to the application.
CDMs can be used in the Installer Preview App right away.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Scene Matching for CDMs is always done on the respective root Document Model. For example use `model : Team_DM` instead of "TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM". There should never be a Match Condition "model":"[Name of Composed Document Model]". |

#### Setup of Master Detail Module With Heterogeneous Child Activity

The following section describes, how a Master Detail Module is created in the App Model Editor of the SME.
It uses the following Document Models (see example above):

* TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM (root Document Model: Team\_DM)
* TeamMemberWithContracts\_CDM (root Document Model: Person\_DM)
* Contract\_DM

with the respective UI Models:

* TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_COM (Overview Model) for TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM
* TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CFM (Form Model) for TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM
* TeamMemberWithContracts\_CFM (Form Model) for TeamMemberWithContracts\_CDM
* Contract\_FM (Form Model) for Contract\_DM

There should be two Bindings with a TableList and "Use CDM Child Activity" set up.
The first is modeled on TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CFM showing the links of Relationship TeamPerson to documents of Person\_DM.
The second is modeled on TeamMemberWithContracts\_CFM showing the links of Relationship PersonContract to documents of Contract\_DM.

The ViewProvider/UI Component names used here are valid for the Preview App and Project Template.

1. **Add new Module to App Model**

   Open the App Model Editor in the SME and add a new entry to the Modules list.
   You may give any attributes to the Activity Descriptor.

   ![CDM AppModel A1 NewModule](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A1_NewModule.png)

   Figure 15. New Module for CDM
2. **Add new Flow to the Module**

   Add a new Flow to the list of Flows of the Module.
   Give a speaking name.

   The following picture shows the Scenes that will be created in the next steps:

   ![CDM AppModel A2 NewFlow](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A2_NewFlow.png)

   Figure 16. New Flow of the CDM Module
3. **Add Scene 1: Overview**

   Add a new Scene to the list of Scenes of the Flow and give it a speaking name.
   You may add a description.

   It is important to set the Match Conditions according to the Activity Descriptor of the Menu Entry (see step 1).
   Add the Match Condition `instance isSet false`, to activate the overview.
   In the next step, we add the Scene Change directives as seen in the picture:

   ![CDM AppModel A3 OverviewScene](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A3_OverviewScene.png)

   Figure 17. Attributes of the CDM overview Scene

   Add the following two *On Enter* directives:

   ![CDM AppModel A4 RegionClear](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A4_RegionClear.png)

   Figure 18. Attributes of the Region\_Clear directive

   ![CDM AppModel A5 ViewAdd](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A5_ViewAdd.png)

   Figure 19. Attributes of the View\_Add directive
4. **Add Scene 2: Detail Form Scene**

   Add a new Scene to the list of Scenes of the Flow and give it a speaking name.
   You may add a description.
   It is important to set the Match Conditions according to the Activity Descriptor of the Menu Entry (see step 1).
   Add the Match Condition `instance isSet true`, to activate this Scene only when a document is selected in the overview.

   Add the Match Condition `model` and enter the name of the respective **root Document Model**.
   So if you want to display TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CFM (Form Model) for TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM, you enter "Team\_DM" here, as it is the root Document Model of TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CDM.

   Do not add a Region\_Clear Directive, but only a View\_Add Directive to the On Enter list.
   This time, enter `FormEngine` as the UI Component name and add the respective Form Model (TeamWithPersonsAndContracts\_CFM) to the Models list.

   ![CDM AppModel A6 FormScene](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A6_FormScene.png)

   Figure 20. Attributes of the Detail CDM Form Scene

   ![CDM AppModel A7 ViewAddofFormScene](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A7_ViewAddofFormScene.png)

   Figure 21. Attributes of the View\_Add directive of the Form Scene
5. **Add Scene 3: First Child Activity Scene**

   Add a new Scene to the list of Scenes of the Flow and give it a speaking name.
   You may add a description.
   It is important to set the Match Conditions according to the Activity Descriptor of the Menu Entry (see step 1).
   Add the Match Condition `instance isSet true`, to activate this Scene only when a document is selected.

   Usually, one would set the `model` Match Condition here.
   If so, do not match for the CDM but for the respective root Document Model.
   Since the same form should be shown for both Subtypes (PersonFreelancer\_DM and PersonEmployee\_DM), do not set the `model` Match Condition.
   This scene would now open for **any** document.
   In order to bind it to the Parent Scene (the one that launched the Child Activity), set *Prior Scene* to be the name of the Detail Form Scene (see above).

   Do not add a Region\_Clear Directive, but only a View\_Add Directive to the On Enter list.
   Again, enter `FormEngine` as the UI Component name and add the respective Form Model (TeamMemberWithContracts\_CFM) to the Models list.

   ![CDM AppModel A8 ChildActivityScene1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A8_ChildActivityScene1.png)

   Figure 22. Attributes of the First Child Activity Scene

   ![CDM AppModel A9 ViewAddofCA1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A9_ViewAddofCA1.png)

   Figure 23. Attributes of the View\_Add directive of the First Child Activity Scene
6. **Add Scene 4: Second Child Activity Scene**

   Add a new Scene to the list of Scenes of the Flow and give it a speaking name.
   You may add a description.

   It is important to set the Match Conditions according to the Activity Descriptor of the Menu Entry (see step 1).
   Add the Match Condition `instance isSet true`, to activate this Scene only, when a document is selected.

   You can limit the activation of this Scene by either setting *Prior Scene* to the name of the First Child Activity Scene (see step before) or by
   setting the `model` Match Condition.
   Let’s decide for the latter here and add `model mustEqual Contract_DM`.
   This Scene is now only shown, when an instance of Contract\_DM is to be displayed.

   Do not add a Region\_Clear Directive, but only a View\_Add Directive to the On Enter list.
   Again, enter `FormEngine` as the UI Component name and add the respective Form Model (Contract\_FM) to the Models list.

   ![CDM AppModel A10 ChildActivityScene2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/relationships_for_bas/assets/CDM_AppModel_A10_ChildActivityScene2.png)
