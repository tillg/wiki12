# Authorization Definition Examples

## RBAC

![AuthorizationFlow](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/authorization_examples/assets/AuthorizationFlow.png)

Figure 1. Visualization of the authorization flow for the `ADD_DOCUMENT` method with the RBAC.

The A12 Data Services method `ADD_DOCUMENT` requires the scopes "Document Create" and "Model Read". The following two examples explain how they are defined in the `authorizationDefintion.json`.

A complete overview about all scopes defined by A12 components can be found at [authorization scopes and access rights of A12 components](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/security/index.html#_authorization_scopes_and_access_rights_of_a12_components).

### Scope "Document Create":

This example will explain all steps of the authorization flow based on the authorization definition for RBAC. As in the image above, the `ADD_DOCUMENT` method is used as example, which checks the *Document Create* scope and the *Model Read* scope. At first, we focus at the *Document Create* scope. The *Model Read* scope validation is explained in the next example, because it is slightly more complex.

The `authorizationDefinition.json` contains next to a `name` and a `description` the nodes `policies` and `permissions`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` {   "name": "Example Authorization Definition",   "description": "Just an example",   "policies": [...],   "permissions": [...] } ``` |
```

The `permissions` node contains a list of permissions. Each with a `name` and a `description`, and technically more important the nodes `scopes` and `policy-refs`. The permission with the name *Document Create Permission* contains the `Document Create` scope. Therefore, UAA will validate this permission for the `ADD_DOCUMENT` method. The `policy-refs` node contains a reference to the policies, which needs to be validated. Here it is only one policy, the *User Has DOCUMENT\_CREATE Right*.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` "permissions": [     ...     {         "name": "Document Create Permission",         "description": "Check that the user has access right to create documents. com.mgmtp.a12.kernel.md.document.apiV2.immutable.DocumentV2 is referenced as #resource.",         "policy-refs": [             "User Has DOCUMENT_CREATE Right"         ],         "scopes": [             "Document Create"         ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

This policy is found in the `policies` node of the `authorizationDefinition.json` and identified by its `name`. To grant access to the requested scope, the rules listed here, must evaluate to `true`. The rules contain a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. In this example, only one rule gets evaluated: `hasAccessRight('DOCUMENT_CREATE')`. This checks if the requesting user, has the access right `DOCUMENT_CREATE` in any of their roles.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` "policies": [     ...   {         "name": "User Has DOCUMENT_CREATE Right",         "description": "Check that current user has access right to create documents.",         "rules": [             "hasAccessRight('DOCUMENT_CREATE')"         ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

At this point, there was no authorization check based on the roles assigned to the models. This will be done with the *Model Read* scope, which is explained in the following.

### Scope "Model Read":

This example will guide thought the *Model Read* scope, which is requested for various methods of A12 Data Services.

In the `authorizationDefinition.json` of Data Services the permission with the name *Model read permission* contains the `Model Read` scope. The `policy-refs` node contains a reference to the *User Has MODEL\_READ Right* policy.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` "permissions": [     ...     {         "name": "Model read permission",         "description": "Check that the user has access right to read provided model. com.mgmtp.a12.model.header.Header is referenced as #resource.",         "policy-refs": [             "User Has MODEL_READ Right"         ],         "scopes": [             "Model Read"         ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

This policy contains three rules, linked by a logical OR. So one them must evaluate to `true`. This policy also contains the optional `dataPreload` node, which contains an array of expressions used to prepare data which can be referenced in the rules. Here `#matchedRequiredRoles` is defined and loads the roles of the user matching the requested model.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` "policies": [     ...    {         "name": "User Has MODEL_READ Right",         "description": "Check that user has access right to read models and matching role with provided model.",         "dataPreload": ["#matchedRequiredRoles = T(com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.utils.ModelUtils).getMatchingRoles(#resource)"],         "rules": [           "@dataServicesCoreProperties.getAuthorization().getRoleBased().isEnabled() == false ||           hasAccessRight('MODEL_MANAGE') ||           hasNestedObjectWithPropertyValue(#matchedRequiredRoles, 'accessRights', 'name', 'MODEL_READ')"           ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

The first rule checks whether the role base authorization is disabled. Some projects want to disable role based authorization when they implement their own authorization checks.

The second rule checks whether the requesting user has the access right `MODEL_MANAGE`. This access right is intendet for roles in modeleling environments and not for production environments. As defined in this policy, roles with the `MODEL_MANAGE` assess right do not need to be attributed to the model to gain access.

In the third rule it is validated whether the preloaded matching roles `#matchedRequiredRoles` contains the `MODEL_READ` access right. This enforces, that only roles that are attributed to the model are checked for its access rights and not all roles a user is potentially assigned to.

If one of these rules evaluates to `true`, the access to scope *Model Read* is granted.

## ABAC

Here we assume, that the default `authorizationDefinition.json` from Data Services remains, and we add additional controls via a child authorization definitions file included via the property `mgmtp.a12.uaa.authorization.childAuthorizationDefinitions`.

We now take the example of querying documents. Here authorization is granted via the *Model Read* scope and since the introduction of the Query API, the *Query* scope, which checks for the access right `QUERY`. We now extend to *Query* scope in the file `childAuthorizationDefinition.json` (as done in the A12 Project Template) and add additional attribute based authorization rules.

At first, it requires a permission with the correct scope assigned:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` "permissions": [     ...     {       "name": "User List Document Permission",       "repository-refs": [         "Document List By User Created"       ],       "scopes": [         "Query"       ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

This permission references to the repository policy "Document List By User Created", which is defined as follows:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` "repositoryPolicies": [     ...      {       "name": "Document List By User Created",       "description": "User is only able to see the documents created by them",       "target": "!containsAnyRole('admin')",       "templates": [         {           "operator": "exact_match",           "field": "/__meta/creator",           "value": "principal.username"         }       ]     },     ... ] ``` |
```

This repository policy contains a target and a templates field. If the target expression (SpEL) evaluates to `false`, the policy is not further evaluated and considered as passed. If it evaluates to `true`, the content of the templates field is added into the query as additional constraint `AND` connected to the existing constraints.

In this example, the repository policy adds a constraint to the query, to only returns documents where the creator of the document equals the requesting user. For users of the admin role, this constraint is not added and eventually all documents are returned.

|  | The permissions and policies of the child authorization definitions add up to the existing authorization definitions of Data Services. This ensures that authorization rules are not weakened. This behavior changes when adding the key-value pair `"call-parent-scope": false` to the permissions of the child authorization definitions. Use with caution! |
