# Task 1 - Document Access

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Backend > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-1-start** to follow along.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-1-end** to see how your code and models differ from the solution.

## Use-Case

As we are extending the CRM system, we are going to add an address validation for our contacts in this task.

Therefore, we will hook into the document creation and update events to validate the added addresses. To verify if the address actually exists, we are going to register and call the Geocoding API, which will take the contacts' addresses as input.

## End Result

Upon finishing this task, you will know:

* How to add additional application properties in the server.
* How to add external libraries to a project.
* How to hook into lifecycle events of documents.
* How to access an A12 document and read its content.
* How to add custom logic for handling address validation.

At the end, our application should display errors after the validation of the inputs as follows:

![address fields validation error](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/assets/address_fields_validation_error.png)

And it should also display an error like the following in the case that an invalid address was entered:

![address opencage validation error](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/assets/address_opencage_validation_error.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The error messages returned by the server for address validation are only available in English. If you select another locale, the error message box will be empty. This is because localization of server-side error messages is only possible with static strings, but the address validation error contains dynamic text messages (the exact issues with the address). |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Understanding Documents

A document is a concrete instance of a [Document Model](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/types_of_models/index.html#_document_model).
It contains the actual data that, for example, a user has entered and saved in a form.
In contrast, the Document Model is an abstraction over all documents, describing one certain object or entity in the business domain.

Example

* We have a Document Model called **Person** with the fields: First name, last name and date of birth.
* One specific document for this Document Model could be represented by: Max, Mustermann and 20.11.1981.

### Accessing a Document

There are different ways to retrieve a document in the backend.
But first, we will take a look at the relevant classes and their relation to each other.

Relevant classes and interfaces:

* `IDocumentModel`: Defines the document’s structure.
* `DocumentV2`: Concrete instance of an `IDocumentModel`.
* `DataServicesDocument`: A wrapper containing a `DocumentV2` instance and a `DataServicesDocumentMetadata` instance (with information like document reference, DM reference, etc.).
* `IElement`: Abstract type for all hierarchical elements of an `IDocumentModel`.
* `IField`: Represents the leaf in the `IElement`-hierarchy and describes an element containing a value.
* `FieldInstanceV2`: Concrete instance of an `IField`, it contains the value of the field.
* `IGroup`: Represents a parent node in the `IElement`-hierarchy and can contain fields (`IField`) and other groups (`IGroup`).
* `RepetitionsV2`: Collection of the concrete repetitions of an `IGroup`. If the group is not repeatable, it contains only one repetition.
* `GroupInstanceV2`: Concrete instance of an `IGroup`, this means, it is a single repetition which can contain instances of fields (see `FieldInstanceV2`) and instances of its subgroups (see `RepetitionsV2`).
* `DocumentPointer`: Reference to a concrete entity instance in a document. It contains the information regarding the path and the repetitions of the entity instance.

Relevant services:

* `IDmAwareDocService`: Provides functionality for `DocumentV2` for which the information in the Document Model is needed, e.g. get entity instances via the id stored in the Document Model.
* `IDocumentModelResolver`: Provides functionality for retrieving an `IDocumentModel` by its id.
* `DocumentServiceFactory`: Provides functionality to create services related to documents, e.g. serialization, search and creation of documents.
* `IDocumentRepository`: Provides functionality for loading a `DataServicesDocument` by using the document reference. This `docRef` is a unique identifier of documents, containing the Document Model name and the document id. Be aware that this access is unsecured.
* And many more that we will take a look at during this task.

Also, have a look at [Data Services > Calling Data Services functionality](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_calling_data_services_functionality). These cover the loading, persisting and some utility in the context of documents.

### Using Event Listeners

It is possible to access a document by reacting to a specific event. The following events are available for use in the context of documents:

* DocumentBeforeCreateEvent
* DocumentAfterCreateEvent
* DocumentBeforeUpdateEvent
* DocumentAfterUpdateEvent
* DocumentBeforeDeleteEvent
* DocumentAfterDeleteEvent
* DocumentAfterLoadEvent
* DocumentBeforeIndexEvent
* DocumentBeforeRepositorySaveEvent
* DocumentAfterRepositoryLoadEvent
* DocumentAfterControllerLoadEvent

You can find a complete overview of all events provided by Data Services in [Data Services > Data Services Events](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#events).
In the following code snippet, you can then see how to register a new event listener for handling such events:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class SampleEventListener {      private SampleService sampleService;      /**      * Before the document is created this code will be executed.      * event.getCreatedDocument() can be changed in place and Data Services will use the new version of document in further processing.      */     @CommonDataServicesEventListener     public void beforeCreateListener(DocumentBeforeCreateEvent event) {         // Put your custom logic here         sampleService.doSomething(event.getCreatedDocument());     }      /**      * Before the document is updated this code will be executed.      */     @CommonDataServicesEventListener     public void beforeUpdateListener(DocumentBeforeUpdateEvent event) {         // Put your custom logic here         sampleService.doSomething(event.getUpdatedDocument());     } } ``` |
```

### Example Address Validation

First, we will take a look at the current state of the application.
It is possible to create contacts and add up to five different address entries.
But, some users may enter addresses like the following:

* Fictional location:

  + Webfoot Walk 1313, Duckburg 12345, Calisota
* Invalid location:

  + V0rd3re Cram3ergasse 11, N4rnb3rg 90478910, #Deutschland

To prevent such input from being stored, a useful and meaningful address validation should be in place.
We will accomplish this by first using internal validation in the backend to filter out invalid locations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There are multiple ways to achieve this internal validation. For example, the A12 validation language could also be used to add rules to our models for the same behavior. However, for demonstration purposes on how to customize server-side behavior, we will implement the validation on our own. |

If an entry is valid according to our defined rules, we will then send a request to a Geocoding API.
In our case, we will use OpenCage to check whether the address corresponds to a valid location.
If it does, the address will be added to the contact.
Otherwise, an error will be displayed, indicating that the provided address is not valid.
The usage of the validation with OpenCage will be configurable via the `application-dev.properties`.

### Developing Address Validation

In this section, we will develop the address validation. To do this, the following steps are necessary:

* Adding a new property for the address validation.
* Creating a new bean that contains the address validation logic.
* Creating a new bean for event listening.

We will include our backend code changes in the `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation`. We will also use the `server/app/src/main/resources` folder to extend the application’s configuration.

#### Already Provided Classes, Configuration, Interfaces and Utilities

Before starting with the implementation for the address validation, we will have a quick look at the included classes, interfaces and utilities in the start tag.

##### OpenCage Dependency

The OpenCage library is provided and added in the `settings.gradle` and the `server/app/build.gradle`.
This allows us to use the necessary functionalities of the Geocoding API.

File: `settings.gradle`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` libs {     //...     version('opencage', '2.2.2')      //...     library('jopencage', 'com.opencagedata', 'jopencage').versionRef('opencage') } ``` |
```

File: `server/app/build.gradle`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` dependencies {     //...      // OpenCage     implementation libs.jopencage } ``` |
```

##### Constants

This class provides static string variables for referencing the name and paths of our Document Model.
These field and group paths will be used to retrieve values from the documents.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/utils/Constants.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.utils;  import com.mgmtp.a12.kernel.md.document.apiV2.DocumentPointer; import lombok.AccessLevel; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;  @NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE) public final class Constants {      public static final String CONTACT_MODEL_NAME = "Contact_DM";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_EMAIL_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/Email";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_LASTNAME_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/LastName";     public static final String CONTACT_PHONES_PATH = "/Contact/Phones";     public static final String CONTACT_ADDRESS_PATH = "/Contact/Address";      public static final String CONTACT_CHANGED_PROPERTY_PATH =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory/ChangeDetails/ChangedProperty";      public static final DocumentPointer CONTACT_POINTER = DocumentPointer.of("Contact");     public static final DocumentPointer CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER = CONTACT_POINTER.withAppended("HistoryInfo", 1);     public static final DocumentPointer CONTACT_CREATED_AT_POINTER =             CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER.withAppended("CreatedAt", 1);     public static final DocumentPointer CONTACT_CREATED_BY_POINTER =             CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER.withAppended("CreatedBy", 1);     public static final DocumentPointer CONTACT_CHANGE_HISTORY_POINTER =             CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER.withAppended("ChangeHistory", 0);      public static final String CONTACT_MODIFIED_AT_FIELD_NAME = "ModifiedAt";     public static final String CONTACT_MODIFIED_AT_POINTER_PATTERN =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory[%s]/ModifiedAt";     public static final String CONTACT_MODIFIED_BY_POINTER_PATTERN =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory[%s]/ModifiedBy";     public static final String CONTACT_CHANGED_PROPERTY_POINTER_PATTERN =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory[%s]/ChangeDetails[%s]/ChangedProperty";     public static final String CONTACT_CHANGE_TYPE_POINTER_PATTERN =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory[%s]/ChangeDetails[%s]/ChangeType";     public static final String CONTACT_CHANGE_REPETITION_POINTER_PATTERN =             "/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory[%s]/ChangeDetails[%s]/Repetition";  } ``` |
```

##### Problem

This interface provides the structure for handling upcoming problems in our address validation.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/utils/Problem.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.utils;  public interface Problem {      String getMessage(); } ``` |
```

##### AddressProblem

This class implements the `Problem.java` interface and will be used to store and handle errors as well as validation problems during the address validation.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/AddressProblem.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  import com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.utils.Problem;  public class AddressProblem implements Problem {      private final String message;      public AddressProblem(String message) {         this.message = message;     }      @Override     public String getMessage() {         return this.message;     } } ``` |
```

##### InvalidAddressException

This exception will be used to forward errors during the validation to our application and frontend.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/InvalidAddressException.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  public class InvalidAddressException extends RuntimeException {      public InvalidAddressException(String message) {         super(message);     } } ``` |
```

##### AddressConfiguration

This configuration class defines a singleton bean of type `JOpenCageGeocoder`, enabling easy injection of this bean into other services that require geocoding functionality.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/AddressConfiguration.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  import com.opencagedata.jopencage.JOpenCageGeocoder; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;  @Configuration public class AddressConfiguration {      @Value("${mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.geocoder.api-key}")     private String geocoderApiKey;      @Bean     public JOpenCageGeocoder getJOpenCageGeocoder() {         return new JOpenCageGeocoder(geocoderApiKey);     } } ``` |
```

The `JOpenCageGeocoder` is the service class from OpenCage that handles tasks such as forwarding our request and providing the response from the Geocoding API.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This setup would make it also easier to deploy to different environments in the later steps of a project lifecycle. |

##### AddressValidator

This class will contain the main logic for handling the address validation of our documents.
At the moment, it only contains the base for the implementation, including:

* The required bean for the validation: `JOpenCageGeocoder`
* The method signature for our entry function `validateAddress`.
* An inner class `Address` for storing all address related attributes in one object.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/AddressValidator.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class AddressValidator {      private final JOpenCageGeocoder jOpenCageGeocoder;      /**      * Checker for input document that has to determine if document is of `Contact_DM` model name. In case of true,      * validation should validate address by calling method implementing validation logic.      * If validation fails custom exception is thrown affecting the response.      * <p>      * If internal validation goes through, OpenCage Geocoding API is used to search for the entered location. Then the      * response will be checked. An exception is thrown when there has been no address.      */     public void validateAddress(DocumentV2 document) {         // Put your code here ...     }      @Data     @AllArgsConstructor     private static class Address {         private String street;         private String houseNumber;         private String zip;         private String city;         private String country;          @Override         public String toString() {             return "{%s %s, %s %s, %s}".formatted(street, houseNumber, zip, city, country);         }     } } ``` |
```

#### Creating an OpenCage API Key

To use the OpenCage Geocoding API, it is necessary to create an API key.
Therefore, you have to [create a new account on OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/users/sign_up).
Once you have logged in, you will find the API key under the "Geocoding API" tab.

#### Adding Properties

Next, we need to ensure that the following properties are defined and configured correctly:

* `mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.geocoder.api-key`: Property for configuring the API key. It is already included in the start tag, and therefore
  you only need to replace the placeholder `YOUR-API-KEY` through your [previously generated API key](#_creating_an_opencage_api_key) for OpenCage.
* `mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressValidation`: It is not included in the start tag. It is a new property to specify whether OpenCage should be used as an additional validation tool in our project.

File: `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-dev.properties`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` #... # JOpenCageGeocoder API key mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.geocoder.api-key=YOUR-API-KEY  # Flag for enabling the address validation mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressValidation=true ``` |
```

#### Creating Bean for Address Validation

We will now begin the implementation of the address validation, as the necessary preparation and configuration are already done.

To accomplish this, we first need to extend the `AddressValidator`. Afterward, we are going to hook into the Data Services document lifecycle events to introduce our address validation logic.

##### Retrieving Data From a Document

We will start by implementing some helper methods to retrieve data from the document.

The first method will be for the retrieval of a string value based on a concrete group instance and a field name.
The method `GroupInstanceV2#directField(String)` can be used to retrieve a field instance by its name. Be aware that the method can return `null` if the field is not present in the group instance.

Having the field instance, we can then retrieve the value by calling `FieldInstanceV2#value()`. After making sure that the value is not `null`, we can convert it to string. If the value is `null`, we return an empty string.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/AddressValidator.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class AddressValidator { 	//...      /**      * Method for retrieval of the string values in a document.      */     private String resolveString(GroupInstanceV2 groupInstance, String fieldName) {         return Optional.ofNullable(groupInstance.directField(fieldName))                 .map(field -> field.value().toString())                 .orElse("");      } } ``` |
```

##### Getting All Addresses in Our Document

In the next step, we will write a function that takes the `DocumentV2` instance and returns all addresses linked to it as a list.
An instance of `DocumentV2` reflects the tree-like structure of the Document Model, and we can have access to the concrete entity instances via the corresponding path. Having this in mind and knowing the path of the address group, we can retrieve all addresses in the document.

Having the addresses, we iterate over them, and we can then use our helper method for resolving a string to get the various field values that are present in each instance of the address group.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/addressvalidation/AddressValidator.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressvalidation;  //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class AddressValidator { 	//...      /**      * A helper method to retrieve all addresses of a document and returns these as a list.      */     private List<Address> getAddressesForDocument(DocumentV2 document) {         List<Address> addresses = new ArrayList<>();          RepetitionsV2 addressGroupInstances = document.groupAllRepetitions(CONTACT_ADDRESS_PATH + "[0]");          addressGroupInstances.stream()                 .forEach(addressGroupInstance -> {                     String street = resolveString(addressGroupInstance, "Street");                     String houseNumber = resolveString(addressGroupInstance, "Housenumber");                     String zip = resolveString(addressGroupInstance, "Zip");                     String city = resolveString(addressGroupInstance, "City");                     String country = resolveString(addressGroupInstance, "Country");                      addresses.add(new Address(street, houseNumber, zip, city, country));                 });          return addresses;     } } ``` |
```

##### Implementing an Address Check

Now that we have everything in place, we can start implementing the internal validation.
This method will run checks on the provided addresses before the request is sent to the OpenCage API.
By doing this, we can avoid sending requests for addresses that we already know are invalid.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For proper error handling during validation, we will use a `List<AddressProblem>` instance. Each method will take this list, and if an error occurs, a new `AddressProblem` will be added to it.  If errors have been added to the list during processing, an exception with all the problem messages will be thrown and displayed in the form. We will check the `List<AddressProblem>` instance at the end of the processing to ensure that all errors linked to invalid addresses are collected. |

Your task:

Add the following methods to the `AddressValidator.java` class to provide helper methods that we will use in the next step.

1. `checkForNumber` which takes a string value and the list of problems. It returns whether the value contains a number.
2. `validateStartingLetter` which takes a string value and the list of problems. It returns whether the value starts with a letter.
3. `validateZip` which takes a string value and the list of problems. It returns whether the value is a valid zip code.
4. `checkAddress` which takes an `Address` and the list of problems. It uses the aforementioned methods and returns a boolean depending on the result.

##### Putting Everything Together

All of our helper methods are ready, so we can start implementing our main method `validateAddress` and put everything together.

Your task:

This method shall perform the following steps:

1. Check if the input document is a `Contact_DM` model.
2. Create a list of `AddressProblem` in which we will store all errors that occur during the validation.
3. Iterate over the list of all addresses in the document and call the `checkAddress` function for each one.
4. For each address, create a `JOpenCageForwardRequest` with the query being in this format: `<street houseNumber, zip, city, country>`.
5. Configure the request to use a `minConfidence` of 10, set `noDedupe` to `false` and use the `JOpenCageGeocoder` instance to forward the request.

   * The confidence relates to how accurate the location response is from OpenCage.
   * `noDedupe` means that if set to false, redundant data will be eliminated from the results list; hence, the term of deduplication is used.
6. Forward the request with the help of `JOpenCageGeocoder` and store it in a `JOpenCageResponse` instance.
7. If the response is not `null` and the result is empty, add a new `AddressProblem` to our list of problems.
8. Check if the problems list contains any entries. If so, throw an `InvalidAddressException` containing all the error messages.

#### Creating Bean for Event Listening

To be able to react on a specific event, it is necessary for us to implement some event listener methods.
To do this, we will create a new bean to call our address validation which listens on the following events:

* DocumentBeforeCreateEvent
* DocumentBeforeUpdateEvent

Your task:

1. Create a new bean called `AddressValidationListener` that uses the `AddressValidator` in `addressvalidation`:
2. Use the `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotation with our new property `mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.addressValidation`.
3. Implement two event listeners, one for `DocumentBeforeCreateEvent` and one for `DocumentBeforeUpdateEvent`.

```

|  | In the Data Services repo, you can also find a similar example for address validation, see [AddressValidator.java](https://github.com/mgm-tp/a12-dataservices/blob/main/examples/examples-extending-server/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/examples/document/extension/document/AddressValidator.java). |

### Running the Application

Now that everything is set up, we can run our application. Next, you can test the changes that we did in action.
Try creating a contact with some valid addresses and then check how the application behaves if you enter an address that does not fulfill the requirements of our address validation rules.

You can find instructions on how to build and start the application in [Tutorials > General Information > Setup](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html#_setup).
Since we only modified the `server/app` module, you do not have to build the entire application; you can simply execute the following command:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:build ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You might run into **Checkstyle** compile errors. If that is the case, you can either run the build with `gradle build -P skipCheckstyle=true`, set the **skipCheckstyle** property in `gradle.properties` to `true`, or fix the Checkstyle errors. |

If you would like to load some initial data, you can also run the init app before starting the server:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:init:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env,init-data' ``` |
```

When you create a new document and enter an invalid address that conflicts with our specified validation rules, your form should return an error similar to the following:

![address fields validation error](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/assets/address_fields_validation_error.png)

Alternatively, if the address meets the validation rules but does not actually exist, the form should display the following error:

![address opencage validation error](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/assets/address_opencage_validation_error.png)

Otherwise, if you enter a valid address for a contact (e.g. "Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin, Deutschland"), the document should be successfully created.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is possible that even if you enter a valid and existing address, that OpenCage does not find it with a `minConfidence` of 10. You can try setting another value, e.g. lowering it. |

## Conclusion

In this task, you learned how to

* access data in documents,
* introduce validation for invalid data, and
* hook into lifecycle events of a document for injecting custom logic.

If something does not seem right, or you got stuck at any point, just check out **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-1-end** to see
the differences between both implementations.

|  | Remember that it is necessary to provide an API key for OpenCage. Therefore, refer to the chapter [Creating an OpenCage API key](#_creating_an_opencage_api_key) for instructions on creating the key, and replace the placeholder `YOUR-API-KEY` in `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-dev.properties`. |

|  |  |

|  | When you test your implementation, keep in mind that server-side error messages for address validation are only shown in English. If you select another locale, the error message box will be empty. This is because localization of server-side error messages is only possible with static strings, but the address validation error contains dynamic text messages (the exact issues with the address). |
