# Tutorial: Basic Modeling

## Prerequisites

The target audience for this tutorial are business analysts. Some prior knowledge of the tools is not presumed.
The tutorial focuses on modeling the most simple local application possible.
Whilst this tutorial has no prerequisites, it is designed to complement the A12 Fundamentals Training.

This tutorial uses the [installer](https://geta12.com/installer/) which you can download from geta12.com.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please ensure your installer version matches this tutorial. |

## Use-case

I want to create a shopping list with all the products I want to buy.
Therefore, I want to be able to add or delete products.
I also want to be able to sort and filter my entries.
The end application should provide a list of products I can review in an overview and a simple form to create new entries.

![Use-case](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/use-case-schema.png)

Figure 1. Use-case schema

## End Result

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to deploy your models so that you can:

* Add new products to your shopping list
* View the products on your shopping list
* Delete products from your shopping list
* Sort and filter products

If you need to check your work as you do the tutorial, please refer to the expandable sections at the end of each step:

You can find a list of models that you created as well as fullscreen pictures of each step to guide you.

## Essentials of Modeling With A12

The modeling part is done in the Simple Model Editor.
Within the Simple Model Editor you can choose between different types of Modeling Editors to create different types of models.
The types of models we use in this tutorial are roughly presented in the following schema.

![Modules schema](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/Modules-schema.png)

Figure 2. Interaction of Models

### What Can I Do With a Simple Application Based on the Standard A12 UX Pattern?

A12 enables business experts to create custom applications, which fit their business requirements exactly.
Therefore, complex applications can be modeled without writing a single line of code.
The modeling takes part in the Simple Model Editor, which is the main tool of A12.
Within the Simple Model Editor you are able to define, which data should be collected, how the forms will look like and how the data is displayed to the administrator.
Furthermore, the default ***A12 Plasma Design System*** supports you with predefined views and functionality based on the usual requirements of business applications.
A12 uses the same information architecture as lots of your office applications. To sum it up: A12 enables you to easily create a user-friendly business applications.
To read more about the Plasma Design System, please check out the [Plasma Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/index.html).

### How Can I Apply the Models in This Simple Application to Different Use-Cases?

In this tutorial, we want to create a Shopping List, where the user can enter, view, delete, sort and filter data.
In this simplified use-case we define the data, which should be collected, in the ***Document Model***.
In the ***Form Model*** we define the visual appearance of our form.
To review and edit existing entries, the ***Overview Model*** is used.
The Overview Model also adds the functionality to sort and filter the data in the list.
The filter is activated by default and the user can choose which data is sortable.
Even if we use this simple use-case, we are able to demonstrate the core functionality for business applications: Entering, deleting, sorting and filtering data.

For now, we create a shopping list for our own wishes, but you would go through the same steps to model more complex applications for your business use-case.

### What Does the Standard A12 UX Pattern Look Like in the UI?

The usual way to display data is the [***Master Detail View***](https://geta12.com/docs/plasma/plasma-concept-documentation/index.html#_master_detail_layout).
In this view, you’ve got two slots: An overview (***"Master"***) and a ***"Detail"*** slot.
You are familiar with this screen layout since it is used by many applications of your daily use for good reasons:
With the Master Detail Layout, you are able to get a good overview when working with large sets of business objects.
The ***Master*** slot can contain a ***table***, a ***list*** or a ***gallery*** while the detail slot usually contains a ***form*** or a ***table***.
***Buttons*** for ***navigating***, ***saving***, ***canceling*** or other interactions can be added to predefined sections: To the ***subheader*** and the ***footer*** section.
This supports the intuitive usage of your application.
You can read more about the UI/UX Design in the [A12 UI/UX documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/a12_uiux/index.html).

### How Does the Standard A12 UX Pattern Compare to Other A12 Options?

In addition to the Master Detail view, A12 also provides you with other views like a ***Dashboard*** or a ***Gallery*** view.
In these views, you can customize the overview based on the data and the type of data your application is built on.
Based on that, you can also navigate to other views and have Master Detail views as well implemented in your application.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please note, that custom layout options will need development support. |

You can look at various layout options in the [A12 Widget Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/index.html#/examples/gallery).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Plan Your Fields

As A12 follows a data-first modeling philosophy, let’s start by looking at what data we need for our shopping list.
We need a field where we can enter products to get a list of desired products.
Therefore, we plan a single string field to enter text information.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace

Perform the following steps to follow this tutorial.

#### Step 2a: Launch the Preview App Controller

![PAC](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step2a.png)

Figure 3. Preview App Controller

* Open the folder where you installed the A12 installer.
* Launch the Preview App Controller.
* Click on “New Workspace” at the bottom of the window.
* Select a folder, where you want to store your workspace and the models you will create in this tutorial and call it "Basic Tutorial".

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is recommended to use the default workspace folder which provides the demo workspaces as well. |

#### Step 2b: Launch the Simple Model Editor

![text Step2b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step2b.png)

Figure 4. Open your Workspace

Once the Workspace is created:

* Close the Preview App Control.
* Launch the Simple Model Editor.
* Open the Workspace you just created by using the "Open Workspaces" button

When opening a workspace, make sure that the auth folder is visible to the Simple Model Editor.
Therefore, always open your Workspace on workspace level.
That means, that you have to choose the folder which was named by you.
If you see the "auth" folder in your Workspace Explorer, you’ve done everything correct.

![Step2c SelectWorkspace](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/Step2c_SelectWorkspace.png)

Figure 7. Select your new Workspace

### Step 3: Model Your Document Model

We start by adding our first Document Model to the workspace.

#### Step 3a: Create a Document Model

![text Step3a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step3a.png)

Figure 8. Product\_DM

* Click on "ADD" in your Workspace Explorer.
* Select "Document Model".

In the dialog window:

* Chose the "Models" folder as the folder for your Document Model.
* Name it "Product\_DM".
* Add the locales: "en,de" (these annotations work as a comma-separated list).
* Add the roles "tester" and "reviewer" via the drop down menu.

Like that, you can add English and German labels to your application.
To read more about that, please head over to the [locales documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html#txt%3Areference%3Alanguages).
Also, you would have the opportunity to implement role-based settings later on by adding different roles. To read more about that, please head over to the [UAA Documentation for developers](https://geta12.com/docs/user_management/um-documentation-src/index.html).

Finish the initiation of your Document Model:

* Click on "Ok" to initialize the model.

#### Step 3b: Add a Root Group

![text Step3b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step3b.png)

Figure 9. Add your root group

After you initialized a Document Model, it will open right away.
In the right half of the screen, you see the structure of your model.
To add a field, we have to model a group first.
Have a look at the [Group documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html#txt%3Areference%3Agroups) for further information.

* Select your Document Model in the Workspace Explorer.
* Click on “+ADD” in the main section of your Document Model.
* Choose "Group".

When initializing a group, the Group Editor opens on the right-hand side.

* Give the group a unique name.

In this case, we create a very simple model, so call this first and only group “Product”.
We have chosen this name due to our naming convention that the root Group should take a similar name to the Document Model.

* Save your changes to the group by clicking the Apply button on the bottom right-hand side.

#### Step 3c: Add a Field

![][height=450](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step3c.png)

Figure 10. Add a new field

Now we can add the field we planned [step 1](#Basic_text_Step1).

* Right-click on the group you just created
* Select "Field".

Immediately the Field Editor pops up on the right-hand side.

* Enter a name for the new field ("Product").
* Enter a label for the new field ("Product" in English and "Produkt" in German).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note, that we have labels for English and German because we’ve chosen both locales when we created the Document Model. In every following step, you should label elements for the locales you’ve chosen. |

* Once again save your changes to the field by clicking the Apply button on the bottom right-hand side.
* Hit the Save button to save the changes you’ve done to the model.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

Figure 16. Settings in the Field Editor

### Step 4: Model Your Form Model

To be able to interact with your Data Model, you need to create a Form Model which defines how the data should be collected.

#### Step 4a: Create a Form Model

![text Step4a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step4a.png)

Figure 17. Add a Form Model

* Click on "ADD" in your Workspace Explorer.
* Select "Form Model".
* Chose the "Models" folder as the folder for your Form Model.
* Fill in the name "Product\_FM".
* Select the related Document Model.
* Check the box next to "Build Screens from Fields".

Like that, the Simple Model Editor does the heavy lifting for you and creates Controls for your Fields automatically.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Every available fields in your Document Model will be taken into account. This includes metadata which we don’t need in this tutorial. We’re going to delete them from our Form Model in a few steps. This meta data is visible to the Form Model as well as to the Overview Model. So please be aware of the fact that the Simple Model Editor displays meta data fields which you haven’t modeled yourself. |

* Choose locales and the roles like you did for the Document Model.
* Click on "Ok" to initialize the model.

By clicking “Ok”, the Form Model opens and presents its automatically generated content in the middle section, where on the right you see the related Document Model.

Now you see the basic structure of your Form Model.

#### Step 4b: Delete Metadata

![text Step4b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step4b.png)

Figure 18. Delete Metadata Screen

As mentioned in the info box above, the Document Metadata is part of the Form Model Tree since these Fields got read by the Form Engine. They are not needed in this tutorial. Therefore, the respective screen should be deleted as well as the Button Panel to navigate to this screen.

* Right-click on the screen "\_\_meta".
* Select "Delete Screen".
* Confirm the deletion.

After cleaning up the Form Model, you are presented with the final structure of the Form Model Tree.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | By right-clicking on the top level row ("form model content") you can choose "Expand All" or decide to "Collapse All" later on. |

#### Step 4c: Add and Delete Buttons

![text Step4c](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step4c.png)

Figure 19. Subheader and Footer settings of the Form Model

To store data, you have to model a “Save” button.
In case you want to cancel your input, you should also model a “Cancel” button.
These buttons can be modeled in the settings tab.

As you also see an error in the settings tab, lets correct this error and add the buttons.

* Click on the "settings" tab of the Form Model.
* Navigate to “Subheader and Footer” in the secondary menu.
* Delete the two "Navigation" buttons, "Product" and "\_\_meta", from the "Subheader Major Buttons".

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | These buttons are unnecessary as you only have one screen.  You see an error as the \_\_meta screen does not exist as you deleted it in [Step 4b: Delete Metadata](#Basic_text_Step4b). |

* In the “Footer Major Buttons” section, click on "ADD" to add cancel and save buttons to your form.

For the Cancel button:

* Give it the name "Cancel".
* Select “event\_cancel” as the event.
* Enable "Destructive" to make the button red.
* Use "Cancel" for the English label and "Abbrechen" for the German label.
* Click on Commit and continue with the Save button.

For the Save button:

* Give it the name "Save".
* Select “event\_submit” as the event.
* Select the priority "Primary" to make the button more prominent.
* Use "Save" for the English label and "Speichern" for the German label.
* Click on Commit.

Finishing your button modeling:

* Click on Apply once more to commit your changes.

#### Step 4d: Add Labels

![text Step4d](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_basics/assets/text_Step4d.png)

Figure 20. Label your Form Model

To recognize the Form Model in the end application, we need to label it.

* In the “settings” tab of your Form Model, navigate to “Settings” in the secondary menu.
* Scroll down until you reach the label section.
* Give it the label "Product", as we want the user to enter a desired product in the form.
* Click on Apply to commit your changes.
* Hit the Save button to save the changes you’ve done to the model.

Figure 53. Deploy your Workspace

The models you created have to be deployed in order to be displayed. Therefore, perform the following steps:

* Return to the Simple Model Editor.
* Click on the "Configure Server Connection" button which can be found in the top right-hand corner of the Simple Model Editor.
* Enter the username “admin”.
* Enter the password "a12".
* Click on "connect"

Once the Simple Model Editor is connected to the local server, the models can be deployed.

* Click on the "Deploy" button in the subheader region of your Workspace Explorer.

Once the deployment was successful, you can return to your browser and open your application.

* Refresh your browser tab.
* Select the "My Shopping List" tab.

You will need to follow this workflow each time you restart the Preview App Control.

## Glossary

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Control** | A control in the Form Model is the interface for the end user to add data to a field of our Document Model. |
| **Document Model** | In the Document Model you define, which data should be collected. Validation and Computation Rules are also Part of the Document Model. |
| **Field** | We use fields in the Document Model to define a column in our set of data we want to collect. |
| **Field Editor** | The Field Editor opens on the right-hand side when a new field is initialized or an existing field gets selected. In the Field Editor, you can inspect and edit the field properties. |
| **Form Model** | In the Form Model you define the layout for your forms. Please have the UI/UX Guidelines in mind when you model your forms. |
| **Master Detail Model** | In the Master Detail Model you connect your Overview Model and your Form Model. This Model is only used to test your models. The integration of your models in the end application will be done in the Application Model by a developer. |
| **Overview Model** | In the Overview Model you customize the displayed overview and define, which actions are available in the overview. |
| **Preview App Control** | With the Preview App Control you can start a local server to test your application. New workspaces are created with the Preview App Control as well. |
| **PreviewApp\_AM** | The PreviewApp\_AM is initialized automatically when a new workspace is created. Do not make any changes to this model or delete it - that may render your workspace useless. The only change you can make to that model is to reference your Master Detail Models in there. |
| **Simple Model Editor** | The Simple Model Editor is the modeling tool to create and edit models. Most of your modeling work can be done just with that single tool. |
| **Workspace** | Your Workspace is displayed in the Simple Model Editor as a bundle of your models. Beyond that your Workspace folder on your computer contains the whole set of data which is needed to run your application. A new Workspace is created in the Preview App Controller. |
