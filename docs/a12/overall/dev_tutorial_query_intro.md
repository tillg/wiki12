|  | Using an older version of Bruno could cause problems when opening the provided Bruno collections. Therefore, make sure that you are using Bruno in a version specified above. |

## Introduction

### Query API

With the 2025.06 release, Data Services introduced a new query mode to retrieve document related data from the server.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you want to get familiar with the Query API in more detail, you can have a look at the [Data Services > Query API](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_query_api) documentation.  This tutorial will cover all feature aspects of the new API, but it will not represent its reference documentation, and not go into details about how the queries are processed internally. |

We will start with the first question that you probably have now:
Why is there a new API for querying document data?

There are multiple reasons and implications, which led to the implementation of the new Query API:

* **Granular field selection**: It allows you to specify which specific fields from the Document Model should be included in the query results. This eliminates the need to load entire documents with irrelevant data for a given request.
* **Enhanced relationship and CDM query support**: The new API structure enables efficient retrieval of linked data and composed document data, improving flexibility and accuracy when working with complex relationships.
* **Custom document graphs**: It supports the creation of custom document graphs, empowering you to query and structure data, including root, child and link documents.
* **Improved performance**: Querying and indexing performance are enhanced. Data Services have transitioned from Solr to PostgreSQL, leveraging its advanced features to improve query capabilities and efficiency.
* **Aggregations**: Compute document data by using a set of functions, and group the computed document results.
* **Feature parity with the old API**: Despite these enhancements, the new Query API maintains feature parity with the previous data retrieval API, ensuring consistency in functionality and authorization. It was not technically possible to achieve in every aspect, but Data Services introduced new opportunities to create complex queries (see [2025.06 Migration Instructions](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_feature_parity)).

### Extended Model Workspace

If you are interested in the general workspace of the tutorial, then check out [Tutorials > Intro > Modeling](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_intro_modeling/index.html).

The model workspace of the tutorial application has been extended in this Query API tutorial to cover features like heterogeneity, relationships and CDMs. For this, the following models have been added:

![modelgraph](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_query_intro/assets/modelgraph.png)

Table 1. Workspace Models


| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General | `ContactPotential_DM` | Subtype of `Contact_DM`, which represents a potential customer with limited data fields. |
| General | `ContactPotential_FM` | Corresponding Form Model to display the `ContactPotential_DM` Document Model. |
| General | `ContactFinal_DM` | Subtype of `Contact_DM`, which represents a customer contact with more data fields. |
| General | `ContactFinal_FM` | Corresponding Form Model to display the `ContactFinal_DM` Document Model. |
| General | `Company_*` | Similar structure as the contact models but represent company entities. |
| Relationship related | `CompanyContact` | Relationship Model between `Company_DM` and `Contact_DM`. This specifies for which company the customer contact is working for. One contact can only be employed at one company. One company can have multiple different contacts employed. |
| Relationship related | `RoleAdditionalField_DM` | Specifies the role a contact has in the company. Options are "Executive", "Managerial", "Operational" and "Other". |
| Relationship related | `RoleAdditionalField_FM` | Corresponding Form Model to display the `RoleAdditionalField_DM` Document Model. |
| CDM related | `Employment_CDM` | Composed Document Model for merging `Contact_DM` and `Company_DM` via the relationship `CompanyContact`. |
| CDM related | `EmploymentFinal_CDM` | Composed Document Model for merging `ContactFinal_DM` and `Company_DM` via the relationship `CompanyContact`. This is used in an "Employment" module in the application. |
| CDM related | `EmploymentFinal_CFM` | Corresponding Form Model to display the `EmploymentFinal_CDM` Document Model. |
| CDM related | `EmploymentPotential_CDM` | Composed Document Model for merging `ContactPotential_DM` and `Company_DM` via the relationship `CompanyContact`. This is used in an "Employment" module in the application. |
| CDM related | `EmploymentPotential_CFM` | Corresponding Form Model to display the `EmploymentPotential_CDM` Document Model. |
| CDM related | `Employment_COM` | Corresponding Overview Model to display `EmploymentFinal_CDM` and `EmploymentPotential_CDM` documents in one overview. |

|  |  |

|  | To follow the tutorial, it is only necessary to understand which Document Models are present in the workspace and how they are structured. This knowledge is required to be able to understand and create queries in the dedicated tasks. |

### Simplified Logical Notation

Queries and their constraints can become quite complex when combining multiple logical operators. Therefore, we will be using a simplified notation to represent such complex logical structures:

Table 2. Notation Elements


| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `∧` | Combines conditions with a logical "AND". Meaning that both conditions have to be met to satisfy the constraint. |
| `∨` | Combines conditions with a logical "OR". Meaning that at least one condition has to be met to satisfy the constraint. |
| `¬` | Negates a condition. |
| `has` | Specifies the relationship related condition with the following syntax: `has(<RELATIONSHIP\_MODEL>, <TARGET\_ROLE>, <CONSTRAINT>) |
| `==` | Constraint that represents the `exact_match` field-aware operator. Meaning that a value has to fully match to satisfy the condition. Using `==` in combination with `null` represents the `undefined_match` operator. |
| `<=` | Constraint that represents the `double_range` field-aware operator. Meaning that a value has to be equal or less than the specified number to satisfy the condition. |
| `>=` | Constraint that represents the `double_range` field-aware operator. Meaning that a value has to be equal or greater than the specified number to satisfy the condition. |

See the following example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` (Contact.LastName == "Miller" ∨ Contact.LastName == "Baker") ∧ ¬Contact.Gender == "MALE" ∧ has("CompanyContact", "Company", Company.CompanyName == "Servicing Good Ltd.") ``` |
```

Here, all contacts will be returned, which

* have the last name "Miller" OR "Baker", AND
* are not male, AND
* are employed at the company "Servicing Good Ltd.".

### Request Collections

In this tutorial, we will use Bruno for creating and executing HTTP requests.
You will find the Bruno collections in the tutorial project in the `bruno/*.json` files.
These contain the examples and solutions for each hands-on task.
The following collections are provided:

* `bruno/task1/collection-task1-start.json`
* `bruno/task1/collection-task1-end.json`
* `bruno/task2/collection-task2-start.json`
* `bruno/task2/collection-task2-end.json`
* `bruno/task3/collection-task3-start.json`
* `bruno/task3/collection-task3-end.json`

This means, if you are interested in the solution and need an additional hint, you can check out the respective `-end` tag at any time and import the corresponding collection in Bruno.
Instructions on how to work with the requests and set up your Bruno environment are provided in the dedicated tutorial chapters.

## Overview

This tutorial serves as an introduction into the Query API, which Data Services introduced for retrieving data from the server. This will replace the existing Data Services RPC operations for receiving document related data with the 2025.06 A12 release.

You will receive an explanation about what the Query API is, its feature set, and how to migrate existing queries to the new structure. The tutorial focuses on the server-side Query API changes and how to work with the new query layers.

The following aspects will be covered in these tasks:

* [Task 1: First Steps](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_first_steps/index.html)
  Explanation of the general Query API structure, instructions to enable the query mode and sending a first request.
* [Task 2: Discovering Queries](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_discovering_queries/index.html)
