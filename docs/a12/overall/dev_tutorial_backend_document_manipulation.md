# Task 2 - Document Manipulation

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [this general information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and the [introduction to this tutorial](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_intro_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-start** to follow along.

If you get stuck, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-intermediate** or **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-end** (depending on the point you are stuck at) to see how your code differs from the solution.

## Use-Case

For our CRM system, we will implement a change history in this task. We will track information about when changes were made over the course of one year, by whom, and provide a general overview of what changes were made to a contact.

As in task 1, we will also hook into the document creation and document update events. When creating a document from the Document Model `Contact_DM`, we will extend the data to include the information **created at** and **created by**. With each update of a document from the same Document Model, we will extend the data in the document to include the information **modified at**, **modified by** and **change details**. In addition to that, we will remove entries in the change history that are older than one year. The new data will be returned to Data Services so that it can be persisted.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Some of the data, we are dealing with in this task, can be also found in the metadata of the document which is delivered by Data Services. However, we will not use it since we want to show how to manipulate data in a document. |

## End Result

Upon finishing this task, you will know:

* How to manipulate data in a document, especially in repeatable groups.
* How to generate typed accessor classes for a specific Document Model to work with documents more conveniently.
* How to use those generated typed accessor classes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Extended Model Workspace

If you are interested in the general workspace of the tutorial, then check out [Tutorials > Intro > Modeling](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_intro_modeling/index.html).

The model workspace of the tutorial application has been extended for this task.

The following models were extended:

* `Contact_DM`: The group `/Contact/HistoryInfo` was added. This new group contains all the fields needed for this task.

![contact dm extension](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/assets/contact_dm_extension.png)

* `Contact_FM`: The collapsible section **ChangeInfo** under **Screen1** was added. This extension was mainly done to display the information added in the backend. Although this is not strictly necessary for this task, it serves as an effective way to test our changes.

![contact fm extension](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/assets/contact_fm_extension.png)

### Working with Documents

As you learned in [Tutorials > Backend > Document Access](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/index.html), in A12, Data Service takes care of the management of documents and provides an API to get access to them. But when working directly with documents, i.e. reading or modifying the content, we have to refer to the A12 component [Kernel](https://geta12.com/docs/kernel/kernel-documentation-dev/index.html).

In A12, Kernel is a low level component which, from a developer point of view, mainly provides the functionality around the data validation and computation based on the data. Within its scope, Kernel provides a so-called Document API to deal with documents. At the moment, there are two versions of it:

* V1

  + Mainly identified by the interface `IDocument`.
  + The main reason why this version was created was the data validation and the execution of computations.
  + Represents the data in a flat hierarchy composed by a collection of entity (field and/or group) instances which are identified by the corresponding absolute path and the corresponding repetitions.
  + The API is mutable.
  + Due to the difficulty to work with this version, it is deprecated and must not be used anymore.
* V2

  + Mainly identified by the interface `DocumentV2`.
  + Represents the data in a tree-like structure with nodes pointing to concrete entity instances in the document.
  + The API is immutable.
  + As the structure between the document and the corresponding Document Model is similar in this version, the usage is much simpler and more intuitive.

For this task, we will only focus on the Document API V2.

### Modification of a Document

As mentioned previously, we will hook into the document creation and document update events from Data Services. In the [Task 1 of the Backend tutorial](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/index.html), a further example regarding implementing a custom event listener can be found.

Your task

* In the package `com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.change.info`, create the class `ChangeInfoListener.java` with a skeleton structure (no implementation yet) so that we can implement the event listener for the events `DocumentBeforeCreateEvent` and `DocumentBeforeUpdateEvent` there.
* Have a look at the class `ChangeInfoService.java` which contains a skeleton structure where we will implement the logic related to the modification of a document.

```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For the implementation, there are two ways to leverage Kernel capabilities:  * Generic approach where hard-coded paths from Document Model fields and groups are used to access the document * Specific approach tailored for a concrete Document Model, where typed classes are used to access the document.  The choice of which approach to use is left to the user of the API since it always depends on the concrete case. In this task, we will examine both approaches. |

#### Common Information

The following aspects will be needed in both approaches:

* The field type of the fields **CreatedAt** and **ModifiedAt** is **DateTime**, so we will need an `Instant` object to set their value.
* In the class `ChangeInfoUtils`, we are going to add methods whose implementation does not differ between both approaches. The class initializes two beans which we are going to need later on, and provides the method to retrieve the current user via Spring.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/utils/ChangeInfoUtils.java`

```

| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.utils;  //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class ChangeInfoUtils {      private final IModelLoader<IDocumentModel> documentModelLoader;     private final DocumentModelServiceFactory docModelServiceFactory;      public String getUserName() {         return ((UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal()).getUsername();     }  } ``` |
```

#### Generic Approach

Let us list the interfaces that will assist us in the implementation with this
approach (some of these interfaces are already known from [Tutorials > Backend > Document Access > Accessing a Document](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_access/index.html#_accessing_a_document)):

* `DocumentV2`: Represents a specific instance of a Document Model.
* `GroupInstanceV2`: Represents a specific instance of a group in a
  Document Model.
  Note: For a repeatable group, there can be more than one instance of the
  same group in the document.
* `RepetitionsV2`: Represents the repetitions of a group in a Document Model.
  This interface is for repeatable groups especially useful.
* `FieldInstanceV2`: Represents a specific instance of a field in a
  Document Model. For filled fields, it contains a typed value.
* `DocumentPointer`: Represents an identifier for a specific entity (field or group)
  instance in a document. This identifier contains information about the entity
  path and the specific repetition indices of all its ancestors. Internally, it is
  defined as `List<PathPart>`.
* `PathPart`: Tuple of entity name and corresponding repetition index.
* `UpdateAction`: Contains the information necessary to make a change in a document.
  This is especially useful when multiple changes need to be made to the document
  at once.

##### Provided Code

In the class `Constants`, you will already find the definition of some instances of the interface `DocumentPointer`, e.g. `Constants.CONTACT_POINTER` or `Constants.CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER`. With this Kernel API, you can also work with paths, but to make more extensive use of the API, we decided to use `DocumentPointer` wherever we could.
Some of the constants follow a path-like structure, e.g. `Constants.CONTACT_MODIFIED_AT_POINTER_PATTERN` or `Constants.CONTACT_CHANGED_PROPERTY_POINTER_PATTERN`. That follows the pattern of the string representation of a pointer where each argument will be replaced by the specific repetition index of the corresponding repeatable group.

```

##### Implementation

Your task:

* Implement the method `ChangeInfoService#setCreationInfo`:

  + The method should be executed only if we have a document of the Document Model
    `Contact_DM`.
  + Retrieve the current user and create an `Instant` object with the current timestamp.
  + Have a look at the methods provided in the interface `UpdateAction`.
  + Create a list of `UpdateAction` in order to add the following field values:

    - "/Contact/HistoryInfo/CreatedAt=<Instant object with the current timestamp>"
    - "/Contact/HistoryInfo/CreatedBy=<current user>"
    - Think about the constants already defined in `Constants`.
  + Apply the previously created list to the document (see method `withBatchUpdates`).
  + Return the updated document.
* Call the method `ChangeInfoService#setCreationInfo` in `ChangeInfoListener#beforeCreateListener`.

```

|  | When reviewing the methods provided in the `DocumentV2` interface, we could use the method `withFieldValue`. However, based on the implementation, each update would produce a new `DocumentV2`-object which could affect the performance of the application. That’s why it is recommended to gather all changes and apply them all simultaneously as we did before. |

While updating a document (the next step), there are mainly two actions which should be implemented:

* Remove entries from the change history older than one year.
* Update the modification information if there are relevant changes in the document.

Your task:

* Implement the utility method `ChangeInfoService#getDocWithEntriesUpToDate(DocumentV2)`:

  + Iterate over all the repetitions of the group `/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory`.
  + Based on the field `ModifiedAt`, filter the entries that are older than 1 year.
  + Return a document with up-to-date entries.

```

The implementation of the following method does not differ between the two approaches and therefore, it should be implemented in `ChangeInfoUtils`.

Your task:

* Implement the utility method `ChangeInfoUtils#determineRelevantFieldChanges(DocumentV2 document, DocumentV2 reference)` which returns a list with changes in relevant fields:

  + With the method `DocumentV2Utils.compare` from the Kernel API, determine the changes in the document.
  + If there are no changes, an empty list is returned.
  + If there are changes, determine the relevant ones: The enumeration values of the field `/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory/ChangeDetails/ChangedProperty` contain the relevant field names.
  + Getting the entity name of a `DocumentPointer` is something which should be provided as a separate small utility method.
  + Return the relevant field changes.

```

Your task:

* Implement the method `ChangeInfoService#updateModificationInfo`:

  + The method should be executed only if we have a document of the Document Model `Contact_DM`.
  + Call the method `getDocWithEntriesUpToDate` and from now on, the returned document will be your "docWithUpToDateEntries".
  + Determine the relevant field changes calling the method `determineRelevantFieldChanges`.
  + If no changes are present, return the `docWithUpToDateEntries`.
  + If there are relevant changes, update the change history:

    - Retrieve the current user and create an `Instant` object with the current timestamp.
    - Determine the next available repetition for the group `/Contact/HistoryInfo/ChangeHistory`.
    - With this information, you can now create a corresponding `UpdateAction` for setting the values for the fields `ModifiedAt` and `ModifiedBy` considering the next available repetition.
    - Based on the relevant changes, you can iterate over them to create the corresponding `UpdateAction` for creating the following fields:

      * `ChangedProperty` - set the name of the field which was changed as value.
      * `ChangeType` - map the returned values of the methods `Change#isAdd` and `Change#isDelete` to a valid enumeration value for the field.
      * `Repetition` - set the repetition of the parent of the field which was changed as value. The method for extracting this information should be implemented in `ChangeInfoUtils`.
    - Apply all the gathered `UpdateAction` instances to the document and return the resulting one.
* Call the method `ChangeInfoService#updateModificationInfo` in `ChangeInfoListener#beforeUpdateListener`.

```

The implementation is now complete. If you got stuck, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-intermediate** to see how your code differs from the solution for the generic approach.

##### Testing

You can (re)start the server, see also [Tutorials > General Information > Setup > Running the Code](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html#_running_the_code), and play around in the application:

* Create a new contact and check the corresponding information.
* Update some properties of a contact and check the modification info.
* If you want to check the implementation regarding outdated modification info, you can import the data in `import/data/request/ContactsWithOldModificationInfoRequest.json`, see also [Tutorials > Intro > Project Template > Creating New Contacts on Start-up](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_intro_project_template/index.html#_creating_new_contacts_on_start_up).

  + Open the contact **Max Mustermann** (you will see outdated modification info).
  + Save it.
  + Reopen the contact and check that the outdated information is not there anymore.

#### Specific Approach

With this approach, the implemented solution works for a specific Document Model, or for Document Models that share a part of the model, i.e. the paths which you want to deal with can be found in all the corresponding models.
Out of the specific Document Model, Java classes are generated and reflect the group-field structure defined in the model. For the Document Model itself and for each group, the following sources are generated:

* Class `P<name>.java`: where `name` is the Document Model id or the group name. This class is categorized as "pointer class" and represents a document pointer from a parametrized root to the entity represented by the class.
* Class `<name>.java`: This class is categorized as "view class", allows the access to the data in the document and the creation of document pointers rooted at the entity represented by the class.
* Package(s) `_<name>`: In plural since the two class categories, just mentioned above, are organized in the packages `views` and `pointers`, and you might find such package in each of them, especially when having nested groups.
  Later on, we will have a look at the structure generated out of our Document Model `Contact_DM` in order to better understand what is actually produced.

Some of the advantages of this approach are:

* You get specific type checking at compile time:

  + While implementing the solution, you know exactly which type you should use.
  + Structural changes in the corresponding Document Model are recognized in an earlier stage.
* You can use the auto-completion in your IDE while implementing the solution.

From the interfaces listed in the previous approach, `UpdateAction` will also assist us in this approach. Additionally, we should have a look at the following methods which are available in the view classes:

* `_pointer()`: This method is available in view classes and allows the creation of **typed** document pointers rooted at the entity represented by the class.
* `TypedGroupView#_at(pointer)`: It provides access to the specific part of the document identified by the pointer.
* `TypedGroupView#_with(pointer, object)`: It creates an instance of the view class with the specified object set at the document part identified by the given pointer.
* `_unwrap`: This method is available in the **typed** pointer classes and returns the untyped corresponding object, e.g. `DocumentPointer`.

##### Generation of Typed Accessor Classes

The generation of the typed accessor classes can be done manually via a CLI-tool provided by Kernel, see [Kernel > Document API V2 (Java) > Manual Code-Generation via CLI](https://geta12.com/docs/kernel/kernel-documentation-dev/index.html#_manual_code_generation_via_cli). For this task, we decided to configure Gradle in order to automatically generate the classes at build time. The Gradle scripts which are used for this task are already adapted and we will now have a look at the configuration.

From the Project Template version 202506.2.0 onwards, the necessary Gradle configuration for generating typed accessor classes is already included in the template. Therefore, if you started with this or a later version of the Project Template, you just need to adapt the arguments for your project.

The following configuration is already included in the base code and shown here for reference.
The only adaptation you need to make is to update the `packagePrefix` to match your project’s package name.

File: `server/app/build.gradle`

```

If you run respective Gradle task by `gradle compileGeneratedTypingsJava`, the typed classes will be generated and compiled. After doing this, those classes will be available in the classpath.
You will find the generated classes in the directory `server/app/build/generatedTypings` with the following structure:

* pointers

![generated typed pointer classes](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/assets/generated_typed_pointer_classes.png)

* views

![generated typed view classes](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/assets/generated_typed_view_classes.png)

Now, in your IDE, type "CDM" in an existing class, and you should be able to see `com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.typings.views.Contact_DM` in the list of suggestions displayed in your IDE.

![generated typed classes autocompletion](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/assets/generated_typed_classes_autocompletion.png)

##### Extension of the Implementation

We should now point out that the main differences between the two approaches is the way how to create the document pointer. In some parts in the first approach, we used instances of the interface `DocumentPointer`, and in other parts hard-coded patterns of the string representation of `DocumentPointer` pointing to the entity we wanted to deal with. In this approach, the document pointer can be obtained from the generated view classes as shown below:

* non-repeatable entities

```
PContact<Contact_DM> contactPointer = Contact_DM._pointer().contact(); // corresponds to "/Contact[1]"
PHistoryInfo<Contact_DM> historyInfoPointer = contactPointer.historyInfo(); // corresponds "/Contact[1]/HistoryInfo[1]"
```

* repeatable entities

```
TypedRepetitionsPointer<Contact_DM, Phones, PPhones<Contact_DM>> phonesPointerAll = contactPointer.phones(); // corresponds to "/Contact[1]/Phones[0]" -> all repetitions of Phones
PPhones<Contact_DM> phonesPointer1 = contactPointer.phones(1); // corresponds to "/Contact[1]/Phones[1]"
```

Once the generated classes are available in the classpath, and we know how to create the document pointers, we can proceed with the implementation of the change history with the typed classes.

Your task:

Define corresponding constants of typed pointers for `CONTACT_POINTER`, `CONTACT_HISTORY_INFO_POINTER`, `CONTACT_CREATED_AT_POINTER`, `CONTACT_CREATED_BY_POINTER` and `CONTACT_CHANGE_HISTORY_POINTER`.

```

Your task:

Expand the implementation with this approach:

* Create the new class `com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.change.info.ChangeInfoServiceTyped` and add the method `setCreationInfo(DocumentV2)`.
* Reimplement the method `setCreationInfo`, the logic is the same as in `ChangeInfoService` but the implementation should be with the typed classes.
* Change the type of the class field `ChangeInfoListener#changeInfoService` to `ChangeInfoServiceTyped`.

```

The implementation is now complete. If you got stuck, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-end** to see how your code differs from the solution for the generic approach.

##### Testing

To make sure that the implementation with this approach works as expected, you can check it as you did it for the first approach, see [these instructions/suggestions](#test_implementation). Since **Max Mustermann** might no longer contain outdated modification information, you can use the contact **Maria Perez Ortiz** to check the correspoding part of the implementation.
If you want, you can compare the classes `ChangeInfoService` and `ChangeInfoServiceTyped` to each other to identify the differences between both approaches.

## Conclusion

In this task you learned that in order to work with documents, it is necessary to have the following information at hand:

* **entity path** for read and write actions, this is the information with which a non-repeatable entity can be identified in a document.
* **repetitions** (or repetition indices) for read and write actions, absolutely necessary for repeatable entities. Together with the entity path, a repeatable entity can be identified in a document.
* **value** for read and write actions on fields.

You also learned the following:

* There are two approaches while working with documents.
* The use of the one approach does not exclude the use of the other.
* The typed accessor classes immensely improve the developer experience and offer an early detection strategy of structural changes in the involved Document Models.

If you got stuck, you can just check out **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-intermediate** or **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-2-end** (depending on the point you are stuck at) to see differences between both implementations.
