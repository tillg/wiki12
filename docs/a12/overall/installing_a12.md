# Installing A12

The A12 Modeling Environment Installer is a convenient way for getting all available A12 tools for modelers of A12 models. It could be seen as single source of truth for receiving matching versions of A12 tools based on A12 overall releases.

To simplify usage for non technical users, the A12 Installer takes care of loading tool dependencies and pre-configurations.

## Included Tools

The A12 Installer is a utility to get the A12 Modeling Environment onto your local machine.

The Installer and certain products are platform specific.
Please follow the instructions below and in the Installer itself.

The Installer will put the components of your choice into an A12 release line specific folder.

## Download

Download the A12 Modeling Environment Installer on [geta12.com](https://geta12.com/installer/).

## Installation

Once you have downloaded the installer for your operating system, you need to extract the compressed file (zip/tgz).

Figure 1. Extract all (Windows example)

If you have already extracted an installer to the chosen directory, you will be asked if you want to replace some files. Please select 'Replace' or cancel and choose a different/new folder for the installer.

Ubuntu - Click here to see more information

In Ubuntu, you have to tell your system how to handle executable script files. Therefore, to use the shortcut files in installation root by double click you have to set it explicitly. To do so, open: "Files > Preferences (could be found in the dropdown of files menu bar) > Behavior > Executable Text Files", then change to "Run them" or "Ask what to do".

The installer will now start and you can select the folder where you want the Modeling Environment to be installed. Please be sure to choose a folder where you have *Read*, *Write* and *Execute* permissions for the current user. Have a look at the section, [Permissions](#permissions) for more information. We recommend using a unique name for each installer version, for example “A12 Tools - 2024.06-ext2” for the ext2 version of the 2024.06 release line. Please note the installer will overwrite old versions of A12 if you choose an existing folder, and you may lose data.

The installer will now install the tools and sample workspaces. This may take a few minutes so please be patient. Once the installation has finished, a green notification will be shown.

## Permissions

The user running the A12 Installer needs to have *Read*, *Write* and *Execute* permissions for the selected target directory. This may mean that you need to speak to your IT Admins to install the A12 Tools for you. After the installation, your user profile needs to have Read, Write and Execute permissions for the folder which the tools are in.

Windows - Click here to see more information

On Windows, it is normally sufficient to install the tools on the C:\ drive but not in Program Files as only Admin-Users have the required permissions for the Program Files folder.


MacOS - Click here to see more information

If you are a Mac user you can choose any target directory as your user profile will determine if a folder has Read, Write and Execute permissions.


Ubuntu - Click here to see more information

If you are running Ubuntu you should simply execute the installer with the necessary permissions and choose a folder (preferably in your home directory).

### What if my tools do not open or function correctly?

If you do not have the necessary permissions discussed in the section, [Permissions](#permissions) you may need to change the permissions for your user for the folder where you installed the tools. If this is not possible, you may need to re-install the tools in a folder where you do have Read, Write and Execute permissions.
