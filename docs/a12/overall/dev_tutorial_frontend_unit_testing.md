# Task 6 - Unit Testing

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Frontend > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We are using Vitest as the testing tool for this tutorial. If you are new to Vitest or are not familiar with it, please take a moment to read through the [official Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) before continuing. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/frontend/task-6-start** to follow along this tutorial.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/frontend/task-6-end** to see how your code differs from the solution.

## Use-Case

In [Tutorials > Frontend > Application Frame](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_application_frame/index.html), we enhanced our CRM application by customizing the application frame with a logo, footer, and localized title. The footer now includes navigation links to Help and FAQ pages, improving the overall application structure.
Additionally, in [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html), we extended the customer functionality by implementing a birthday highlighting feature for our contact management page.

Beyond component testing, understanding how to test A12’s core functionality is crucial for building robust applications. In [Tutorials > Frontend > Application Frame > Modules](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_application_frame/index.html#_modules), we learned about modules, and when working with frontend applications, we should also understand data reducers. These are both key concepts that manage how features are loaded and how data flows through your application’s state management system. These components also require thorough testing to ensure your application behaves correctly under different user scenarios and data states, making them essential areas to cover in our testing tutorial.

Given the importance of unit testing to ensure code quality and reliability, we will now extend our application’s development workflow to include thorough testing coverage for these key components.

In this tutorial, we will write unit tests for the footer, some components in the Contact module, and core A12 functionality, including middleware and data reducers. To achieve this, we will set up Vitest as our testing framework, write comprehensive test cases covering both UI components and business logic, and finally analyze our test coverage percentage to ensure we have adequate testing in place.

## End Result

By the end of this task, you will have learned:

* How to set up a test environment that works with A12 applications.
* How to write comprehensive and maintainable test cases for your components.
* How to generate and analyze test coverage reports.

At the end, our project should be covered by unit tests and achieve a code coverage of at least 80% for code branches and functions covered for the targeted components within the tutorial.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Before we begin, let us outline why we are choosing Vitest as the testing tool for our frontend environment:
Vitest is a modern testing framework built on top of Vite, but it also works perfectly fine even if your project is not using Vite. Vitest can still be integrated smoothly, offering a consistent test environment without the need for complex configuration.
For background reading, see [Vitest > Guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/) and [Vitest > Features](https://vitest.dev/guide/features.html).

With the release of A12 version 2025.06, many of the core packages were migrated to the new ESM (ECMAScript Module) syntax structure along with their internal dependencies. Traditional testing tools such as Jest still struggle with ESM support, often requiring experimental flags or complicated setups. In contrast, Vitest was designed with ESM as a first-class concern, making it especially suitable for this transition.

Beyond compatibility, Vitest provides excellent performance, leveraging modern build techniques to deliver very fast test runs, instant re-runs, and efficient developer feedback loops.

It is also highly compatible with Jest, so existing Jest-style test cases can often be reused with little or no modification, making the migration process straightforward and the learning curve gentle for developers already familiar with Jest.

At the same time, Vitest’s ecosystem is still newer and not yet as broad as Jest’s. This is something you should be aware of when choosing it as the main testing tool for your project. Please consider the project timeline and scale carefully to ensure you are selecting the most suitable tool.

By understanding these points, we can see why Vitest is suitable for our frontend testing tutorial.

### Already Provided Test Utilities

The `client/src/tests` folder contains one setup file `setup.ts` that provides the basic test setup and includes mocks for browser features needed by A12 components.
In the same folder, there is also a `utils.tsx` file that provides some utility functions for our tests, such as rendering components with the necessary context providers.

### Setting up the Test Environment

#### Folder Structure

For this tutorial, to keep your tests organized and easy to maintain, it is recommended to structure the `client/src/tests` directory in the following way.

```
src/
├── components/
├── modules/
│   └── ...
└── tests/
    ├── components/
    │   └── Footer.test.tsx
    ├── reducers/
    │   └── TodoDataReducer.ts
    ├── constants.ts
    ├── setup.ts
    └── utils.tsx
```

As you can see, the `tests` folder is separated into:

* The `components` folder, which contains our component test files.
* The `reducers` folder, which contains our reducer implementation and test file.
* Inside the `tests` folder, there are some files which include basic setup, utilities, and mock data for our tests.

#### Dependencies

For our testing, we will use Vitest as the test framework along with React Testing Library for rendering and interacting with React components. We will also use Vitest’s built-in mocking capabilities to mock API calls and other dependencies.

For test coverage analysis, we will use `@vitest/coverage-v8` which provides fast and accurate coverage reports.

We will start by updating our project’s dependencies. Therefore, the following libraries have been added to our `package.json` file.

File: `client/package.json`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` {   //...  "devDependencies": {     "vitest": "^4.0.3",     "jsdom": "^26.1.0",     "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",     "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.9.1",     "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1",     "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^4.0.3",     "@vitest/ui": "^4.0.3",     //...   }   //... } ``` |
```

Run `npm install` to install these dependencies.

Additionally, test scripts have been added to our `package.json` to run our tests more easily:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` {     //...     "scripts": {         //...         "test": "vitest",         "test:ui": "vitest --ui",         "test:coverage": "vitest run src/tests/components/ --coverage"     }     //... } ``` |
```

These scripts provide different ways to run your tests:

* `npm run test`: Runs tests in watch mode for development.
* `npm run test:ui`: Opens Vitest’s UI interface for interactive testing.
* `npm run test:coverage`: Generates test coverage reports by running only component tests to focus on the HighlightedDateOverview module within the scope of this tutorial, avoiding coverage dilution from unrelated tests.

#### Configuration

Next, a Vitest configuration file has been added to set up our test environment properly.

File: `client/vitest.config.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";  export default defineConfig({     test: {         environment: "jsdom",         globals: true,         clearMocks: true,         setupFiles: ["./src/tests/setup.ts"],         include: ["src/tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"],         coverage: {             reporter: ["text"],             include: ["src/modules/contact/components/HighlightedDateOverview/**"]         }     } }); ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | We will only generate coverage reports for the `HighlightedDateOverview` folder in the scope of this tutorial. That is why we specify the `include` option in the coverage configuration. In a real-world scenario, you would typically want to include all relevant source files in your coverage reports. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To keep this tutorial simple, we configure the coverage reporter to use text mode only. You may extend this configuration by adding additional reporter modes such as `json` or `html` to generate different formats of coverage reports for your project needs. |

Additionally, the TypeScript configuration has been updated to exclude test files from the compilation process. This ensures that Vitest can run tests independently with its own TypeScript processing, while keeping test files out of the production build where they don’t belong.

File: `client/tsconfig.json`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {     "compilerOptions": {         // ... other options     },     "include": [         "./src/**/*"     ],     "exclude": [         "./src/tests"     ] } ``` |
```

To ensure that your IDE (for example IntelliJ IDEA) provides proper autocomplete for Vitest globals and jest-dom matchers in test files, a separate `tsconfig.test.json` has been created that extends the base `tsconfig.json`.
This configuration includes the `src/tests` directory and references the Vitest and jest-dom types.

File: `client/tsconfig.test.json`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` {     "extends": "./tsconfig.json",     "compilerOptions": {         "types": ["vitest/globals", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]     },     "include": [         "./src/tests"     ] } ``` |
```

Then reference it from your `vitest.config.ts` by adding the `typecheck.tsconfig` option:

File: `client/vitest.config.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export default defineConfig({     test: {         //... existing options         typecheck: {             tsconfig: "./tsconfig.test.json"         }     } }); ``` |
```

### Implementing Test Files

#### Footer

A test file for the Footer component has already been created at `client/src/tests/components/Footer.test.tsx`.
It contains our first test case, which checks for the presence of the "Help" and "FAQ" links in the footer component:

File: `client/src/tests/components/Footer.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` describe("Footer", () => {   it("renders the footer with links", () => {         renderWithProviders(<Footer />); (1)          expect(screen.getByText("Help")).toBeInTheDocument(); (2)         expect(screen.getByText("FAQ")).toBeInTheDocument(); (2)     }); }); ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Our custom render function that wraps the component with necessary providers. |
| **2** | Assertions to check if the links are present in the document. |

This test follows a concise approach that directly renders the Footer component and verifies the presence of the "Help" and "FAQ" texts. However, to properly render the Footer component, we must wrap it with the necessary context providers required by A12 components. This is accomplished using the `renderWithProviders` function from our `utils.tsx` file. Let’s examine the implementation in the utils file:

File: `client/src/tests/utils.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 ``` | ``` //... other imports  /** Shared Redux store */ const reducer = (state = {}) => state; const store = createStore(reducer);  /** Mock dispatch */ const mockDispatch = vi.fn();  /** Replace store's dispatch with mock dispatch */ store.dispatch = mockDispatch;  /** Shared localizer context */ const locale = { language: "en", country: "US" }; const dataFormats = defaultDataFormats(locale); const conversion = defaultValueConversion(dataFormats); const localizer = defaultLocalizerFactory({     locale,     conversion,     dataFormats,     translationSource: DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS });  export function renderWithProviders(ui: React.ReactElement, options = {}) {     const result = render(         <Provider store={store}>             <LocalizerContext.Provider value={{ locale, conversion, dataFormats, localizer }}>                 <ThemeProvider theme={flatTheme}>                     <SizeContext.Provider value={{ currentSize: "lg" }}>{ui}</SizeContext.Provider>                 </ThemeProvider>             </LocalizerContext.Provider>         </Provider>,         options     );      return {         ...result,         mockDispatch     }; } ``` |
```

This utility file sets up a shared Redux store and localizer context that can be reused across multiple tests. The `renderWithProviders` function wraps the provided UI component with the necessary providers, ensuring that it has access to the Redux store, localization, theming, and size context.

Now we will enhance our testing by adding another test case to verify the Footer component’s interactive functionality. This test will ensure that the links are properly rendered as clickable elements and that the correct Redux actions are dispatched when users interact with them.

Your task:

* Inside the `Footer.test.tsx` add another test case `'should verify footer functionalities'`.
* Import `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event` and create a `UserEvent` instance by calling `userEvent.setup()`.
* Extract `mockDispatch` from the `renderWithProviders` return value.
* Get the footer links using `screen.getByText()`.
* Verify that the links render as `<a>` tags using `.tagName.toLowerCase()`.
* For each of the footer links, do the following:

  + Use `await user.click()` to simulate clicking the link. The `await` is important because user events are asynchronous.
  + Assert that `mockDispatch` was called with the correct Redux action type and payload for the respective link.
* Run `npm run test` to verify all tests are passing.

File: `client/src/tests/components/Footer.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 ``` | ``` //... import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";  //...    it("should verify footer functionalities", async () => {         const user = userEvent.setup();         const { mockDispatch } = renderWithProviders(<Footer />);          const helpLink = screen.getByText("Help");         const faqLink = screen.getByText("FAQ");          // Verify that the links are clickable elements (should render as anchor tags)         expect(helpLink.tagName.toLowerCase()).toBe("a");         expect(faqLink.tagName.toLowerCase()).toBe("a");          // Test clicking Help link and verify Redux action is dispatched         await user.click(helpLink);         expect(mockDispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith({             type: "Application/START_MAIN_ACTIVITY_REQUESTED",             payload: {                 descriptor: {                     module: "Help"                 }             }         });          // Test clicking FAQ link and verify Redux action is dispatched         await user.click(faqLink);         expect(mockDispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith({             type: "Application/START_MAIN_ACTIVITY_REQUESTED",             payload: {                 descriptor: {                     module: "Help",                     page: "faq"                 }             }         });     }); ``` |
```

#### Table Cell

Now that we have successfully added tests for the Footer component, let’s proceed to add tests for other components inside the `HighlightedDateOverview` folder.

In [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization > Highlighting the Date](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html#_highlighting_the_date), we implemented logic to highlight contact birthdays when they occur today or within a week by customizing a table cell. Now we need to add tests to verify that this highlighting functionality works as expected.

Let’s first review the `HighlightedDateCell` component to understand how it works and what we need to test.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/HighlightedDateOverview/HighlightedDateCell.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` import type { ReactElement, PropsWithChildren } from "react";  import { DefaultComponentMap, type TableBodyCell } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core";  interface HighlightedDateCellProps extends PropsWithChildren<TableBodyCell.Props> {     textColor: "red" | "orange" | "green"; }  export default function HighlightedDateCell({     textColor,     ...tableBodyCellProps }: HighlightedDateCellProps): ReactElement {     return (         <div className={`-u-text-${textColor} -u-font-semibold`}>             <DefaultComponentMap.TableBodyCell {...tableBodyCellProps} />         </div>     ); } ``` |
```

The `HighlightedDateCell` component is a simple wrapper around the `TableBodyCell` component that adds a colored text style based on the `textColor` prop. The text color can be "red", "orange", or "green", indicating different levels of urgency for the contact’s birthday.

The main thing we need to be aware of here is that it imports `TableBodyCell` from `@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core` package. This means that in order to properly render the `HighlightedDateCell` component in our tests, we need to mock the `@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core` package to provide a mock implementation of the `TableBodyCell` component.

Testing these components in isolation from the complete A12 component tree allows us to focus specifically on their core logic and behavior. By mocking them as simple `div` elements, we create predictable outputs that remain independent of external dependencies or side effects. This approach ensures clean, isolated unit tests that verify only the functionality we intend to test.

Let’s do that in our `setup.ts` file. We will use Vitest’s mocking capabilities to mock the module. Inside the `setup.ts` file, add the following code:

File: `client/src/tests/setup.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` //... other imports import React from "react";  //... existing code vi.mock("@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core", async (importOriginal) => {     const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import("@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core")>();     return {         ...actual,         DefaultComponentMap: {             TableBodyCell: vi.fn(({ children }) =>                 React.createElement("div", { "data-testid": "default-table-body-cell" }, children)             )         }     }; }); ``` |
```

This mock implementation provides simple div elements with data-testid attributes for the `Heading` and `TableBodyCell` components. This allows us to verify that these components are being rendered correctly in our tests.

Now we can proceed to write tests for the `HighlightedDateCell` component. You should create a new test file named `HighlightedDateCell.test.tsx` inside the `client/src/tests/components` folder and add the following code:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ``` | ``` import { describe } from "vitest";  import type { TableBodyCell } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core";  describe("HighlightedDateCell", () => {   //Mock Column Data   const mockColumnModel = {     id: "dateOfBirth",     elementRef: "PersonalData.DateOfBirth",     width: 150,     visible: true,     sortable: true,     editable: false   };    //Mock Row data   const mockRow = {     id: "test-row-1",     data: {       dateOfBirth: new Date("1990-01-15")     }   };    const mockProps: Pick<TableBodyCell.Props, "columnModel" | "row"> = {     columnModel: mockColumnModel,     row: mockRow   }; }); ``` |
```

This sets up the basic structure for our tests. We define a mock column model and a mock row to simulate the data that would be passed to the `HighlightedDateCell` component.

Now we can add our test cases to verify that the `HighlightedDateCell` component styling renders correctly with different text colors. Make sure you import the `HighlightedDateCell` component as well as `render` and `screen` from `@testing-library/react` at the top of your test file. Then add the following test cases inside the `describe` block:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` it("renders if birthday is today", () => {     renderWithProviders(       <HighlightedDateCell {...mockProps} textColor="red">         Birthday Today       </HighlightedDateCell>     ); (1)      const container = screen.getByText("Birthday Today").parentElement; (2)     expect(container).toHaveClass("-u-text-red"); (2)     expect(container).toHaveClass("-u-font-semibold"); (2)   }); ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Render the HighlightedDateCell component with our mock props and "red" text color. |
| **2** | Verify that the container has the correct classes for red text color and semibold font. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To know which utility classes we can use for modifying the component style, such as `-u-text-red -u-text-orange -u-text-green -u-font-semibold`, you can refer to the [Widgets Utility Classes](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/38.3.3/#/basics/utility-classes) documentation. These utility classes are part of the A12 framework and provide a convenient way to apply common styles to components without writing custom CSS. |

There is also a case in which the birthday is within a week, we should test that as well. The implementation is similar to the previous test case, but we will use "orange" as the text color and also modify the display text.

Your task:

* Inside the `HighlightedDateCell.test.tsx` add another test case `'renders if birthday is within a week'`.
* Render the `HighlightedDateCell` component with our mock props and "orange" text color.
* Use `screen.getByText()` to get the text element and then access its parent element.
* Verify that the container has the correct classes for orange text color and semibold font by using `toHaveClass()`.

File: `client/src/tests/components/HighlightedDateCell.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ```   it("renders if birthday is next week", () => {     renderWithProviders(       <HighlightedDateCell {...mockProps} textColor="orange">         Birthday Next Week       </HighlightedDateCell>     );      const container = screen.getByText("Birthday Next Week").parentElement;     expect(container).toHaveClass("-u-text-orange");     expect(container).toHaveClass("-u-font-semibold");   }); ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Instead of running all tests at once, you can run individual test files by using `npm run test HighlightedDateCell` or `npm run test — src/tests/components/HighlightedDateCell.test.tsx`. |

#### Heading

In our actual implementation, to display the birthday highlighting feature, we also customized the page heading to include a toggle button that enables users to switch this highlighting feature on or off. This was accomplished by creating a custom `Heading` component, as detailed in [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization > Adding A Button To The Overview Header](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html#_adding_a_button_to_the_overview_header).

Let’s first examine the `Heading` component to understand its structure and functionality so we can add tests for this component as well.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/HighlightedDateOverview/Heading.tsx`

```

```

The `Heading` component is a wrapper around the default `Heading` component from the A12 OverviewEngine. It adds a button that toggles the `isHighlighted` state when clicked. The button’s icon changes based on the current state of `isHighlighted`.

To properly render the `Heading` component in our tests, we need to ensure that the `DefaultComponentMap.Heading` from `@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core` package is mocked correctly, which we need to do in our `setup.ts` file.

Your task:

* In the existing `setup.ts`, a mock for the Overview Engine’s `DefaultComponentMap` has already been added.
* Extend this mock by adding a `Heading` component in the same way that the `TableBodyCell` component was defined, assigning it the attribute `data-testid: 'default-heading'`.

File: `client/src/tests/setup.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` //... existing code vi.mock("@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core", async (importOriginal) => {     const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import("@com.mgmtp.a12.overviewengine/overviewengine-core")>();     return {         ...actual,         DefaultComponentMap: {             TableBodyCell: vi.fn(({ children }) => React.createElement("div", { "data-testid": "default-table-body-cell" }, children)),             Heading: vi.fn(({ children }) => React.createElement("div", { "data-testid": "default-heading" }, children))         }     }; }); ``` |
```

Now we can proceed to write tests for the `Heading` component. You should create a new test file named `Heading.test.tsx` inside the `client/src/tests/components` folder and add the following code:

File: `client/src/tests/components/Heading.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` import { describe, vi } from "vitest";  import Heading from "../../modules/contact/components/HighlightedDateOverview/Heading";  describe("Heading", () => {   const mockSetIsHighlighted = vi.fn();    const mockHeadingProps: React.ComponentProps<typeof Heading> = {     title: "Contact Overview",     subtitle: "Manage your contacts",     buttons: [],     isHighlighted: false,     setIsHighlighted: mockSetIsHighlighted   }; }); ``` |
```

This sets up the basic structure for our tests. We define a mock heading props to simulate the data that would be passed to the `Heading` component.

Now we can add our test cases to verify that the `Heading` component renders correctly and that the toggle button functions as expected. First, we will verify that the `Heading` component renders the button correctly.

Your task:

* Inside the `Heading.test.tsx` add a test case `'renders heading with toggle button'`.
* Render the `Heading` component with our mock props.
* Use `screen.getByRole('button')` to get the button element.
* Verify that the button is in the document using `toBeInTheDocument()`.

File: `client/src/tests/components/Heading.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` describe("Heading", () => { //... existing code  it("renders heading with toggle button", () => {         renderWithProviders(<Heading {...mockHeadingProps} />);          // Verify that the custom button is present         const button = screen.getByRole("button");         expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();     }); }); ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In our `Heading` component, we have added a prop `primary` to the `Button` component. Instead of `toBeInTheDocument()`, we could also use `toHaveClass('button—​primary')` to verify that the button has the primary styling applied. This would ensure that our button not only exists in the document but also has the correct visual appearance as intended. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You might see a warning about 'non-boolean attribute primary' when running the test. This is coming from the `Button` component which we could mock if needed. However, for the purpose of this tutorial, we can ignore this warning as it does not affect the functionality we are testing. |

Next, we should test the button’s icon to ensure it displays correctly based on the `isHighlighted` state.

Your task:

* Inside the `Heading.test.tsx` add another test case `'renders icon when button is toggled'`.
* Render the `Heading` component with our mock props and `isHighlighted` set to `true`.
* Use `screen.getByText('highlight_off')` to get the icon element.
* Verify that the icon is in the document using `toBeInTheDocument()`.

```

You could get inspired by the above task and add another test case to check when the `isHighlighted` is **false** and verify that the icon should be **highlight**.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For other types of icons, you can refer to the [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) documentation to see the full list of available icons. |

Next, we should test the button container styling to ensure it has the correct classes applied.

Your task:

* Inside the `Heading.test.tsx` add another test case `'renders button with correct styling'`.
* Render the `Heading` component with our mock props.
* Get the button’s parent container by accessing `.parentElement` on the button element you already know how to retrieve from the previous test.
* Verify that the button container has the correct styling classes using `toHaveClass`.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` describe("Heading", () => { //... existing code   it("renders button with correct styling", () => {         renderWithProviders(<Heading {...mockHeadingProps} />);          // Find the button container div         const buttonContainer = screen.getByRole("button").parentElement;          // Verify correct styling classes are applied         expect(buttonContainer).toHaveClass("-u-flex");         expect(buttonContainer).toHaveClass("-u-items-center");         expect(buttonContainer).toHaveClass("-u-justify-end");         expect(buttonContainer).toHaveClass("-u-padding-x-xl");         expect(buttonContainer).toHaveClass("-u-margin-y-sm");     }); }); ``` |
```

Finally, after verifying the rendering and styling of the button, we should test the button’s functionality to ensure it works as expected. We will simulate a click event on the button and verify that the `setIsHighlighted` function is called with the correct argument.

Your task:

* Inside the `Heading.test.tsx` add another test case `'should verify heading functionalities'`.
* Import `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event`.
* Render the `Heading` component with our mock props and `isHighlighted` set to `false`.
* Use `screen.getByRole('button')` to get the button element.
* Use `await user.click()` to simulate clicking the button.
* Assert that `mockSetIsHighlighted` was called with a function argument using `expect.any(Function)`.
* Extract the toggle function from `mockSetIsHighlighted.mock.calls` and verify its logic by testing that it toggles `false` to `true` and `true` to `false`.

#### Custom Middleware

Having successfully implemented tests for the `Heading` and `HighlightedDateCell` components, we should now extend our testing scope to cover critical A12-related Redux implementations beyond just UI component testing.

While we previously discussed Modules in [Tutorials > Frontend > Application Frame > Modules](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_application_frame/index.html#_modules), we will now explore this topic in greater depth. In our `client/src/modules/index.ts` file, we have two key middleware functions:

* `registerModulesOnSetModelGraphMiddleware` - Creates middleware to register the full module set as soon as the model graph is loaded
* `unregisterModulesOnLogoutMiddleware` - Creates middleware to unregister modules when users log out

These middleware functions are essential for managing the application’s state and ensuring that modules are properly registered and unregistered based on user actions.

File: `client/src/modules/index.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` //... existing code /**  * Initializes module registry on `setModelGraph` action.  */ export const registerModulesOnSetModelGraphMiddleware = StoreFactories.createMiddleware((api, next, action) => {     if (ModelActions.setModelGraph.match(action)) {         const registeredModules = moduleRegistry.getAllModules();          if (registeredModules.length > 0) {             logger.error(                 "Module registry already has modules registered with the following ids:",                 registeredModules.map((module) => module.id)             );         } else {             getAllModules().forEach((module) => moduleRegistry.addModule(module));         }     }      return next(action); });  /**  * On logout, unregisters all modules.  */ export const unregisterModulesOnLogoutMiddleware = StoreFactories.createMiddleware((api, next, action) => {     if (UaaActions.loggedOut.match(action)) {         // The logout action has to be processed first so that any existing activities are removed first         const result = next(action);          const moduleIds = moduleRegistry.getAllModules().map(({ id }) => id);         moduleIds.forEach((id) => moduleRegistry.removeModuleById(id));          return result;     }     return next(action); }); ``` |
```

Before writing the middleware tests, we need to add additional mocks to our `setup.ts` file.
The test file will import the middleware functions directly from `client/src/modules/index.ts`.
Since `modules/index.ts` in turn imports from `@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-content-elements` and `@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library`, these packages must be mocked to avoid dependency resolution failures in the jsdom test environment.

File: `client/src/tests/setup.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` //... existing code import React from "react";  /** Mock A12 FormEngine content elements - avoids SVG import chain from widgets-core */ vi.mock("@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-content-elements", () => ({     FormElementsLibrary: { modules: [] } }));  /** Mock A12 ContentEngine default element library - avoids SVG import chain from widgets-core */ vi.mock("@com.mgmtp.a12.contentengine/contentengine-default-element-library", () => ({     DefaultElementLibrary: { get: () => ({ modules: [] }) },     DefaultElementLibraryFactories: {         createModule: () => ({ id: "DefaultElementLibraryModule" })     } })); ``` |
```

These mocks provide minimal implementations of the libraries that `modules/index.ts` depends on, preventing the test environment from attempting to resolve their full dependency trees.

We will now write comprehensive tests to verify the functionality of these middleware. You should first create a new folder named "modules" inside the `client/src/tests` folder and then create a new test file named `Modules.test.tsx` inside the `client/src/tests/modules` folder and add the following code:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` import { describe, beforeEach, vi, expect, it } from "vitest"; import type { MiddlewareAPI } from "redux";  import { ModuleRegistryProvider, ModelActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { UaaActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.uaa/uaa-authentication-client";  import {     getAllModules,     registerModulesOnSetModelGraphMiddleware,     unregisterModulesOnLogoutMiddleware } from "../../modules";  import { testModules } from "../constants";  describe("Modules", () => {     const moduleRegistry = ModuleRegistryProvider.getInstance();     const api = {         getState: vi.fn(),         dispatch: vi.fn()     } as unknown as MiddlewareAPI;     const next = vi.fn((action) => action); }); ``` |
```

This sets up the basic structure for our tests. We import the middleware functions directly from `modules/index.ts`, and inside the describe block we initialize the module registry and create a mock API for testing.

Since we know that we will write tests for different cases of registering and unregistering modules, it is a good practice to reset the module registry and mock functions before each test to ensure that tests do not interfere with each other. We can do this by adding a `beforeEach` block inside the `describe` block:

File: `client/src/tests/modules/Modules.test.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` describe("Modules", () => {    //... existing code     beforeEach(() => {         // Clear all modules from registry         const moduleIds = moduleRegistry.getAllModules().map(({ id }) => id);         moduleIds.forEach((id) => moduleRegistry.removeModuleById(id));     }); }); ``` |
```

Now we can proceed with writing our test cases. We will begin by testing the module registration middleware to ensure it properly loads modules when the model graph is established.

For this test, we will create a mock `setModelGraph` action and configure the necessary spies to monitor the middleware behavior. The test will verify that modules are registered correctly in the registry, that each module is added exactly once, and that the action continues through the middleware chain without modification.

Your task:

* Inside `Modules.test.tsx`, add a test case `'should register modules when model graph is set and continue with action'`.
* Create a plain action object with type `"MODEL_SET_MODEL_GRAPH"`.
* Call the local `getAllModules()` function and store the returned modules so they can be used as the expected list in assertions.
* Use `vi.spyOn` to spy on `ModelActions.setModelGraph.match` and mock it to return `true` for the action.
* Use `vi.spyOn` on the module registry’s `addModule` method to observe each registration.
* Execute `registerModulesOnSetModelGraphMiddleware` with the mocked API, next function, and action.
* Verify that `ModelActions.setModelGraph.match` was called with the action.
* Verify the total call count of `addModule` matches the expected list length using `toHaveBeenCalledTimes`, then verify that `addModule` was called with each module from the expected list using `toHaveBeenCalledWith`.
* Verify that the registry now contains the full module list using `toHaveLength` on `moduleRegistry.getAllModules()`.
* Verify that the `next` function was called with the original action, ensuring the middleware passes the action through the chain.
* Clean up the spies after the assertions so later tests see the original implementations.

```

Now that we have confirmed the modules register properly when the model graph is loaded, we will move on to testing the unregister flow when a user logs out.

Your task:

* Inside the `Modules.test.tsx` add another test case `'should unregister modules after logout and continue with action'`.
* Import `testModules` from `client/src/tests/constants.ts` and pre-register them into the module registry. Verify there are 4 modules.
* Create a logout action using `UaaActions.loggedOut()`.
* Create a spy on `UaaActions.loggedOut.match` using `vi.spyOn` and mock its return value to `true`.
* Create a spy on `moduleRegistry.removeModuleById` method.
* Call the `unregisterModulesOnLogoutMiddleware` with the mock API, next function, and action.
* Verify that `UaaActions.loggedOut.match` was called with the action.
* Verify that the `next` function was called with the action.
* Assert that `removeModuleById` was called 4 times.
* Assert that the module registry is empty after the logout action.

```

We have successfully implemented test cases for both middleware functions. This is one of the most important parts that we should cover when writing tests for A12 applications, as it ensures that our application behaves correctly based on user actions and permissions.

#### Custom Activity Data Reducer

One of the most common use cases when working with A12 applications is implementing a custom activity data reducer. In this final section on unit testing, you will learn how to test a custom activity data reducer effectively.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Data Reducer is a pattern for managing and transforming application state in React by defining pure functions that specify how the state should change in response to dispatched actions. You can learn more about data reducers in A12 in [Client > Data Reducers](https://geta12.com/docs/client/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#/basics/data-reducers). |

Many scenarios exist where implementing a custom activity data reducer is beneficial. For instance, you might need to filter or transform data before displaying it in an activity, or combine data from multiple sources into a single activity. For this tutorial, we will focus on a straightforward example of a custom activity data reducer from the data reducers documentation: a to-do data reducer.

Let’s examine the implementation of this to-do reducer to understand its functionality and determine what aspects require testing. The implementation can be found in the `client/src/tests/reducers/TodoDataReducer.ts` file.

File: `client/src/tests/reducers/TodoDataReducer.ts`

```

Looking at the implementation, we can see that this reducer listens for the `ADD_TODO` action and adds a new to-do item to the list of to-dos in the data holder. The reducer checks if the data holder is of type "todo-list" using the `isTodoDataHolder` helper function before modifying its data.

With this understanding, we can get some ideas about what we need to test. Common scenarios to test for this reducer include:

* Verifying that the action is defined correctly.
* Ensuring that the reducer only modifies matching data holders.
* Verifying the immutability of the state.
* Verifying action type matching.
* How the reducer handles empty or undefined data holders.
* Verifying descriptor and metadata integrity.

There will be more cases that you can come up with, but within this tutorial we will only cover some of them. You should create a new test file named `TodoDataReducer.test.tsx` inside the `client/src/tests/reducers` folder and add the following code:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ``` | ``` import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";  import type { Activity, ActivityActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  import { addTodo, TodoList, AddTodoDataReducer } from "./TodoDataReducer";  describe("TodoDataReducer", () => {     // Setup mock data holders for testing     const mockDataHolder: Activity.DataHolder = {         descriptor: {             use: "todo-list",             id: "todo-holder-1"         },         data: {             todos: ["Learn A12", "Write tests"]         },         slices: {},         dirty: false,         loadingState: "loaded",         savingState: "not_saved"     };      const nonTodoDataHolder: Activity.DataHolder = {         descriptor: { use: "user-profile", id: "user-1" },         data: { name: "John" },         slices: {},         dirty: false,         loadingState: "loaded",         savingState: "not_saved"     }; }); ``` |
```

This sets up the basic structure for our tests by defining mock data holders for testing. We have a `mockDataHolder` of type "todo-list" and a `nonTodoDataHolder` of a different type which we will use for our test scenarios. Now that everything has been set up, we can proceed with writing our test cases.

Your task:

* Inside the `TodoDataReducer.test.tsx` add a test case `'should verify to-do reducer functionalities'`.
* Create an `addTodo` action and verify `action.type` and `action.payload` properties using `toBe()`.
* Create a mixed array of both `mockDataHolder` and `nonTodoDataHolder`, call `AddTodoDataReducer.reduce()` with the action, and verify the result length using `toHaveLength`. Find the updated todo data holder via `.find()`, check it is defined with `toBeDefined()`, and verify its `todos` array content using `toEqual()`.
* Find the unchanged data holder in the result by its `descriptor.use` and verify it is the exact same object reference as the original using `toBe()`.
* Verify immutability by checking that the original `mockDataHolder.data` still contains its original `todos` using `toEqual()`.
* Create an action with an unrelated type, pass it along with the data holders to `AddTodoDataReducer.reduce()`, and verify that the returned array is the same reference as the original using `toBe()`.

Click to see solution

1. Create the test case inside the `describe` block with the specified name:

   File: `client/src/tests/reducers/TodoDataReducer.test.tsx`

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` it("should verify to-do reducer functionalities", () => {     // Test implementation goes here }); ``` |
   ```
2. Start by creating and verifying the `addTodo` action with proper A12 payload structure:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` // Test 1: Verify action creation with required A12 activity payload const action = addTodo({     activityId: "test-activity", // Required by A12 ActivityActionPayload     todo: "Create tutorial" });  expect(action.type).toBe("Tutorial/ADD_TODO"); expect(action.payload.activityId).toBe("test-activity"); expect(action.payload.todo).toBe("Create tutorial"); ``` |
   ```
3. Test the reducer with mixed data holders to verify selective processing:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` // Test 2: Verify reducer only processes matching data holders const mixedDataHolders = [mockDataHolder, nonTodoDataHolder]; const result = AddTodoDataReducer.reduce(mixedDataHolders, action) as Activity.DataHolder[];  // Verify no data holders were added or removed expect(result).toHaveLength(2);  // Find and verify the todo data holder was updated const updatedTodoHolder = result.find((dh) => dh.descriptor.use === "todo-list"); expect(updatedTodoHolder).toBeDefined(); expect((updatedTodoHolder?.data as TodoList).todos).toEqual(["Learn A12", "Write tests", "Create tutorial"]); ``` |
   ```
4. Verify object reference equality for unchanged data holders:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` // Find and verify the non-todo data holder remained unchanged const unchangedUserHolder = result.find((dh) => dh.descriptor.use === "user-profile"); expect(unchangedUserHolder).toBe(nonTodoDataHolder); // Same object reference ``` |
   ```
5. Test immutability by checking original data remains unchanged:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // Test 4: Verify immutability expect((mockDataHolder.data as TodoList).todos).toEqual(["Learn A12", "Write tests"]); ``` |
   ```
6. Test action filtering with unrelated actions to ensure performance optimization:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` // Test 5: Verify action type filtering const unrelatedAction = {     type: "UNRELATED_ACTION",     payload: { activityId: "test-activity" } } as ActivityActions.DataReducerAction; const originalDataHolders = [mockDataHolder]; const unchangedResult = AddTodoDataReducer.reduce(originalDataHolders, unrelatedAction); expect(unchangedResult).toBe(originalDataHolders); // Same reference returned ``` |
   ```

With that, we have successfully completed our comprehensive testing implementation. This final section demonstrates several important concepts when working with A12 Data Reducers.

When implementing custom data reducers in A12 applications, there are several key considerations to keep in mind. Your actions must extend `ActivityActions.ActivityActionPayload` to ensure proper integration with A12’s activity system. The reducer should return the same object reference for non-matching actions - this prevents breaking A12’s internal reducer chain and maintains optimal performance.

Type guards like `isTodoDataHolder()` are essential for safely processing only the relevant data holders while leaving others untouched. This selective processing ensures your reducer doesn’t interfere with unrelated data.

For testing data reducers, you should cover both successful scenarios (when actions match and data is processed correctly) and edge cases (empty arrays, non-matching data holders, and unrelated actions). Testing immutability is crucial - use `expect().toEqual()` to verify data content changes and `expect().toBe()` to confirm object reference equality for unchanged items.

Pay particular attention to preserving A12 metadata during processing. Properties like descriptor, loadingState, savingState, dirty, and slices should remain intact after your reducer processes the data.

The key principles for A12 Data Reducers are selectivity (process only what matches), immutability (never modify existing objects), and performance (avoid unnecessary processing). Following these patterns ensures your reducers integrate smoothly with the A12 framework while maintaining the reliability needed for productive applications.

### Running Tests and Analyzing Coverage

Now that we have written tests for different parts of our application code, we can run our tests and analyze the coverage.

Instead of running each test file individually, we can use the test scripts we added to our `package.json` to run all tests at once.

Vitest also provides a UI interface that allows us to run and monitor our tests interactively. To start the Vitest UI, run the following command: `npm run test:ui`

This will open the Vitest UI in your default web browser. From here, you can see the list of test files, their status (passed/failed), and detailed information about each test case.

![vitest ui](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_unit_testing/assets/vitest_ui.png)

You can click on individual test files to see the test cases and their results. You can also re-run tests, filter tests, and view error messages for failed tests.

To generate a test coverage report, you can run the following command: `npm run test:coverage`

This will run all tests and generate a coverage report. You can then view the coverage table report directly in the terminal.

![coverage report](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_unit_testing/assets/coverage_report.png)

The coverage report provides detailed information about the coverage of your code, including the percentage of lines, functions, branches, and statements that are covered by tests.

Based on the coverage report, we achieved 100% coverage across all four criteria for the components (`Heading.tsx` and `HighlightedDateCell.tsx`) tested within the HighlightedDateOverview module, demonstrating thorough and comprehensive testing practices.

## Conclusion

Having completed this task, you have learned how to set up a unit testing environment and write tests for your components with test coverage analysis.
