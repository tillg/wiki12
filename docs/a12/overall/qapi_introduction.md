# Introduction to the Innovated Query API

The release line 2025.06 innovates the data query capabilities and API in Data Services with impact and effect also on some other components, which integrate with Data Services or use its API, namely: UI engines like the Overview Engine, Tree Engine or Form Engine, and also Workflows and User Management.

Further perspectives:

## For DevOps and Infrastructure

Neither Data Services nor any other A12 component will require Solr as an index or search API anymore. All indexing and data retrieval will be done using Postgres only.
With 2025.06, you can drop Solr from your infrastructure, unless your project is using Solr directly, which is of course still valid.
Please prepare for more focus on Postgres, since all Solr load will shift to Postgres, which has different processing and scalability characteristics – more resources might be required here.

## For Developers

The Project Template in 2025.06 comes with the required configuration. The [Query API Tutorial](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_intro/index.html) helps to get started and understand it. There is a chapter in the [Data Services developer documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_query_api) describing the new features.

Other components, especially UI engines use the new API instead of the old one but so far taking only limited advantage of new capabilities - this will be focus of upcoming releases.
As developer, you can already now customize this and provide UI views with data loaded with the new API in a more sophisticated way, e.g. you could implement a data loader for an Overview with a complex and/or optimized query.

## For Modelers

Please be aware of the chapter [Model-ability](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_model_ability) in the Data Services documentation.

So far, the integration of the new Query API to other components is done with a focus on feature parity, i.e. not all new power of Data Services is yet used in or exposed by other components, e.g. UI engines.
This means to large extent, that data and UI modeling, as well as the resulting application, look and work as before – please be aware of the following To-Dos:

1. All document fields are indexed by default - you might want to remove certain fields from the index, e.g. for performance or security reasons, in this case, please annotate the field with `indexed` annotation with value `false`. All other values for this annotation name are ignored.
   Only indexed fields can be used in **Search**, **Filters** and **Sorting**, e.g. in overviews, the DualPane and DropDown Relationship UIs.
2. Keep the current annotations `enable_approximate_match_search` and `enable_case_insensitive_search` as they are still used by the Overview Engine. Changing these annotations does not require re-indexing anymore.

We plan to enable modelers using the new query capabilities in releases after June.

## For Users

Our goal was feature parity, but due to differences in technologies, there are some effects on feature behavior - please see [feature parity](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_feature_parity), and be aware esp. of the following known or expected differences in behavior:

### New Search Behavior In Standard A12 Applications

* Fields that have the annotation `indexed = false` are NOT considered in the **Full Text Search** of Overviews and DualPane Relationship UIs. Moreover, the autosuggestion in the DropDown Relationship UI also uses the Full Text Search. This means, less documents will be shown.
* Whitespaces in the Full Text Search term are considered as regular character.

  + Due to this, the order of the words (separated with whitespace) in the search terms make a difference.

### New Filter Behavior In Standard A12 Applications

* Fields that have the annotation `indexed = false` do NOT work for Filters. Please make sure, that all Fields shown in the Filter dialog of the overviews are indexed.
* The asterisk `*` can not be used as a term in Filters to retrieve all the Fields with any value. It is treated as regular character.
