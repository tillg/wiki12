# Tutorial: Relationship Modeling

## Prerequisites

The target audience for this tutorial are business analysts.
Some prior knowledge of the tools is assumed.
Before you start this tutorial, you should have completed the following training course(s).
For more details on what topics are covered in these courses, please follow the links.

* [A12 Fundamentals Training](https://geta12.com/#/trainings/training-ba-modeler#modeling-fundamentals-training)

This tutorial focuses on relationships and the relevant documentation is linked below.
The terminology used in this tutorial is explained in the documentation, but we’ve also included a glossary of terms in case you forget what a specific term means:

* [Relationship Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/relationships_for_bas/index.html)
* [Form Modeling - Binding documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-binding-ba-docs/index.html)
* [Glossary of Relationship Terminology](#RM_Glossary)

This tutorial uses the [installer](https://geta12.com/installer/) which you can download from geta12.com.

## Use-case

I have a database containing employees and teams, and I want to be able to add different employees to a team.

I want to be able to select the employees from the employee database so that I can reuse them. This will save me time as I will not have to enter the employee details (name, job title, salary…​) each time I create a team.

I want to be able to specify when each employee joined the team.

There shouldn’t be any limits on how many teams a team member can be used in. This will allow me to set up multiple different teams which may use the same employees but have different roles assigned to the employees.

This can be seen in the schematic diagram below where, for example, Tom is in both Team 1 and Team 2.
Tom joined Team 2 in March 2023, but he has been working in Team 1 since 2016.

![Relationships schema 1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Relationships_schema_1.png)

Figure 1. Use-case schema

## End Result

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to deploy your models so that you can:

* Add new employees in the employee module
* Add new teams in the team module

  + Select employees from the list of current employees to add them to a team
  + Assign a joining Date for the employee in the team using the Additional Link Field
  + Save the new team
* View the team in the overview, open, edit and then save changes to the team
* Assign employees to multiple teams

The end result will be similar to the Person and Company modules of the basic workspace.

The use-case can therefore be represented in a modeling schema that can be seen below.
The Document Models for team, employee and the joining date in the team are shown by boxes.
The Relationship Model that we are going to model is then represented by a line connecting the Document Models.

You can find a list of models that you created as well as fullscreen pictures of each step to guide you.

## Essentials of Relationship Modeling

You may have noticed some differences between the use-case and the end-result sections.
This is largely because the end result uses some specific terminology that you should understand when using Relationship Models.
So, before we get started with the step-by-step modeling guide, let’s clear up any questions you might have about Relationship Models.

### What Can I Do With a Relationship Model?

You can use a Relationship Model to create a connection between two existing Document Models.
An instance of a Relationship Model between two documents is referred to as a ***link***.
You can see an example of this in the use-case where, for example, the employee "Sally" is linked to "Team 1".

While a Document Model contains fields and rules, a Relationship Model has ***roles*** and ***link constraints***.
The roles show which Document Models are connected by the Relationship Model and what roles they play in the relationship.
This is trivial for the relationship shown in the use-case where we create a *link* between a team and an employee.
There are two clear roles, team and employee.

The role becomes more important in a self-referencing relationship, where the same Document Model is used for both roles.
We could use the same employee Document Model but establish two clear roles, boss and worker.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Although the roles appear in a list in the Relationship Model Editor, there is no hierarchy built in, so it does not matter which order the roles appear in. |

The *link constraints* control the maximum number of instances of this role that can be linked to one instance of the other role.
We refer to this as the ***multiplicity*** and, just like a rule, a warning will be shown in the user interface if this *multiplicity* is exceeded.
If there is no limit, the *multiplicity* is called unbounded.

![Link and Additional Link Field](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_RelMod.png)

Figure 3. Link and Additional Link Field

#### Add Additional Information and Allow Duplicate Links

In addition to creating a *link* between two specific instances of Document Models, we can maintain additional information for each *link*.
These are called ***Additional Link Fields*** and they are modeled on a ***Link Document Model***.
This third document is then part of the *link*.

In the use-case mentioned above, the employee "Sally" is linked to "Team 1".
If we model an extra Document Model with a Field for the employee joining date, we can store the information that Sally joined Team 1 on May 1st, 2021 in this additional link field when the link is created.
This information is then specific for this *link*.
In other words without Sally and Team 1 we cannot have Sally’s joining date for Team 1.

This allows use-cases like the one in this tutorial to be modeled, where the same employee "Tom" works in two different teams, "Team 1" and "Team 2", but joined them at different dates.

The checkbox "Duplicable" controls, whether it is possible to have two *links* between the same documents.
This would allow the use-case, that Tom may leave Team 2 at a certain time, but join Team 2 again at a later time.
Note, that the application does not check the content of the Additional Link Fields.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The input for the Link Document Model reference and the checkbox "Duplicable" are only active if the upper limit for *multiplicity* is >1 for both related entities in the Relationship Model. |

If you are considering modeling a relationship with *additional link fields*, you must consider the *multiplicity* modeled in the *link constraints*.
There are two possibilities depending on the business case:

1. If the business case requires that the *multiplicity* of one entity should be set to 1, then the additional link field(s) should be added to the Document Model referenced in the entity with a *multiplicity* >1.
2. If the business case requires that data be saved in an *additional link field*, this is an indicator that the *multiplicity* constraints should be defined as > 1 for both entities.

#### Set the Order of Relationship Information in an Application

By default, the *links* are ordered by their creation time with the newest *links* displayed at the bottom of the list in the UI and the oldest *links* displayed at the top.
If you want to change the order of the *links*, please ask your developer to enable ***Orderable***.
You can then set whether newly created *links* are placed on the top or bottom of the respective list.

The order in which the *links* appear can only be set manually by viewing the *links* in a tree.
After enabling *Orderable* for the child node type, the order maintained in the tree will also be displayed in any Dual Pane Selection or Table List relating to that relationship.

### How Can I Apply a Relationship Model to Different Use-Cases?

The first step in modeling any use-case is planning.
When thinking about the relationships connecting Document Models, we quickly see that the *multiplicity* is key to setting up different use-cases.

When the *multiplicity* is set correctly, the user will only be able to create a plausible number of *links* between specific instances of a document.
As we assign a *multiplicity* of 1, any positive integer, or unbounded to both roles, we have a range of possible combinations open to us.

The most common combinations are listed in the table below:

| Multiplicity of Role A | Multiplicity of Role B | Notation in Documentation | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1:1 | A maximum of 1 document from Role A may be linked to a single document from Role B.  A maximum of 1 document from Role B may be linked to a single document from Role A. |
| 1 | 10  (Example, any positive integer possible) | 1:n | A maximum of 1 document from Role A may be linked to a single document from Role B.  A maximum of 10 documents from Role B may be linked to a single document from Role A. |
| 1 | unbounded | 1:n | A maximum of 1 document from Role A may be linked to a single document from Role B.  There is no limit on the number of documents from Role B that may be linked to a single document from Role A. |
| unbounded | unbounded | n:n | There is no limit on the number of documents from Role A that may be linked to a single document from Role B.  There is no limit on the number of documents from Role B that may be linked to a single document from Role A. |
| unbounded | unbounded | n:n | There is no limit on the number of documents or the number of times any document from Role A may be linked to a single document from Role B.  There is no limit on the number of documents or the number of times any document from Role B may be linked to a single document from Role A. |
| Duplicable | |

#### *1:1* Relationship

A *1:1* relationship is a relationship in which both roles have a maximum *multiplicity* of 1.

If we chose to model this type of relationship for the Employee-Team use-case, then each employee could only work in one team.
In addition, each team could only have one employee.
This might seem strange in the context of employees and teams but is more understandable if we consider a relationship in which we set a team leader.

A team (*1*) - employee (*1*) relationship would allow a single employee to be set as the team leader with the additional restrictions that each team may only have one team leader and each team leader must be different.
This is useful as the number of *links* is validated and the user is informed when the number of *links* exceeds the *multiplicity*.

![Text 121](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_121.png)

Figure 4. *1:1* relationship

#### *1:n* Relationship

A *1:n* relationship is a relationship in which one role has the upper limit of 1 as *multiplicity*, while the other role has a *multiplicity* >1 or an unbounded *multiplicity*.

There are two different ways of applying this type of relationship to the employee-team use-case.
The first is sensible, where a team can have "n" employees but each employee may only be in one team.
The inverse is less sensible, where each employee may be in "n" teams but each team may only have one employee.

As mentioned before, a role’s *multiplicity* controls the maximum number of instances of this role that can be linked to one instance of the other role.
A sensible example would, therefore, be a team (*1*) - employee (*n*) relationship, which is shown in the picture below.

![Text 12n](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_12n.png)

Figure 5. *1:n* relationship

#### *n:n* Relationship

An *n:n* relationship is a relationship in which each role has a *multiplicity* >1 or an unbounded *multiplicity*.

To put this in the context of our use-case, where a team can have "n" employees and each employee may be in "n" teams.
We have the option to set n to a specific integer value or to set it to be unbounded.
Using unbounded *multiplicity*, we can model a team (*unbounded*) - employee (*unbounded*) relationship.

Let’s, however, consider our teams for a moment, should there be a limit on the number of employees in a team?
We could set the *multiplicity* of the employee role to 30, so a maximum of 30 employees could be linked to a single team.
Equally, how many teams can they realistically work in before they become ineffective?
We could set the *multiplicity* of the team role to 5, so that a maximum of 5 teams may be linked with a single employee.
This would lead to a team (*5*) - employee (*30*) relationship which creates an error in the UI when these limits have been exceeded.

![Text n2n](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_n2n.png)

Figure 6. *n:n* relationship

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | *n:n* relationships are the only type of relationships, that we can add a *Link Document Model* to.  This is described in the section, [Add Additional Information](#additional_information). |

#### Self-Referencing Relationships

The use-case and examples that we have discussed so far have always referenced a different Document Model for each role.
It is also possible to reference the same Document Model for both roles in a relationship.
This is then referred to as a ***self-referencing relationship***.

Self-referencing relationships may then be used as any other relationship.
Please note, as the same Document Model is used for both roles, the role becomes more important.
As we mentioned previously, we can use the same employee Document Model but establish two clear roles, team leader and team member.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The depth of Self-Referencing Relationships is unlimited.  Modelers can define the depth of that a Self-Referencing Relationship is queried in Composed Data Models and Tree Models so that the total amount of data being loaded is not (theoretically) unlimited. |

### What Does a Relationship Model Look Like in the UI?

There are plenty of different UI components which can be used on forms to display the *links* between documents.
*Links* can be displayed and edited via the Drop Down Selection, the Dual Pane Selection or the Table List.

Alternatively, the Tree Engine can be used to create a hierarchical overview of linked documents.
We can model additional actions to edit the *links* and create and link a new document in one step, i.e. add parents, siblings or children within the tree.

Relationship UI components can be added to an existing Form Model and are configured using the Binding Editor within the Form Model Editor in the SME.
For more information regarding Bindings, please refer to the [Form Modeling - Binding](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-binding-ba-docs/index.html).

#### Displaying Relationships in a Tree

The Tree Engine can be used to display and edit *links*.
A tree is always hierarchical: the two roles of a relationship need to be divided into ***parent*** and ***child***.

It is possible to display several relationships in one tree, as long as they all descend directly or indirectly from the same Document Model parent.
As all of these Document Models are directly or indirectly descended from the same Document Model, this one is referred to as the ***root*** of the tree.

For more details, please refer to the [Tree Model documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/index.html#_the_tree_model) and the tutorial, [Tree Modeling](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/modeling_tutorial_tree/index.html).

### How Does a Relationship Model Compare to Other A12 Models?

If you have completed the Fundamentals training, you will have already modeled a Repeat on a Document Model.
There a certain parallels between a Relationship Model and a Repeat but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, Relationship Models are very useful for reusing documents which you can view in an overview or linking together in a tree.
This means the user can create *links* by selecting one or more existing documents in the *Binding*.
Data in a Repeat exists with the document and can’t be reused, so the user has to manually enter this data for each new document.

On the other hand, a Relationship Model is more complex than a Repeat and requires more effort.
You can easily add more rows to a Repeat and perform calculations on the data within a Repeat.
You can’t create new documents in a relationship, as there are no UI controls in the *Binding* to add or edit linked documents.
This is only possible using an extra model, either a Tree Model or a Composed Document Model.
Calculations on data across a *link* are also difficult to achieve with relationships, but it is possible using Composed Document Models.

The differences between a Relationship Model and a Repeat on a Document Model are summarized below to help you decide which to use.

Table 1. Repeat vs Relationships


|  | **Repeat** | **Relationship** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Persistence | Information that you enter in a Repeat will be deleted when you delete the document. | Links are between individual documents. You can delete a document and a link separately. Also, if you delete one document, the other linked documents are not automatically deleted. |
| User Interaction | Three types of repeats are available in the Form Engine:  * Inline * Detached * Embedded | Related data can currently be displayed and edited in:  * Drop Down Selection (for single selection) * Dual Pane Selection (for multiple selections) * Table List |
| Create and Edit Children | You can create children in the repeat using nested repeats.  The data in children can then be edited in the form. | You cannot create or edit children in the relationship UI component. You can only add a link to an existing child document.  To create or edit children, you need to create a Tree Model and model a button to insert a new document as a child. Alternatively, linked documents can be created and edited using the relationship UI components for a Composed Document Model. |
| Validation & Computation | Validation and computations can be performed on data from a single document based on a single Document Model.  Per-default, Validation or Computation Rules are evaluated in the frontend and backend. | Validation or computation across linked documents is **only** possible if the relevant Document Models are included in a Composed Document Model.  Per-default, Validation or Computation Rules are evaluated in the frontend only. |
| Workflows | Repeats can be used in workflows. | Workflows supports Relationships and Composed Data. |
| Heterogeneity / Abstractness | Repeats do not support heterogeneity. | Abstract supertypes can be used in heterogeneous relationships. Links can then be made to super/subtype documents.  Heterogeneity at the root level can be modeled using a Composed Document Model for each subtype. |
| Orderability | Data in Repeats can be ordered. | Links can be ordered when displayed in a Tree Engine. |
| Recursion | Repeats cannot be recursive. | Relationships can be recursive. You can model a self-referencing relationship. |
| Performance when Scaling | An increasing number of rows in a repeat will cause the Form Engine to become slower. | Relationships can deal with large sets of documents efficiently. |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Plan Your Relationship

The first step should be thoroughly planning your relationship.
As discussed in the [Essentials of Relationship Modeling](#Essentials_of_relationships), a relationship either connects two different Document Models or connects back to the same Document Model.
In our use-case, this means that we will use one role "Team" and one role "Employee".

As there should not be any limits on how many teams a team member can be assigned to, the multiplicity of the Team role must be > 1.
We also want to be able to have multiple employees in each team.
This means that the multiplicity of the Employee role must be > 1.
For simplicity, the multiplicity for both roles should be unbounded.

The multiplicity of the two roles means that the date on which the employee joined the team can be stored in the Additional Field, as described in the section, [What Can I Do With Relationships](#What_can_I_do_with_relationships).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is generally better to model an explicit upper limit for the Multiplicity rather than using the "Unbounded" checkbox.  This can help with:  * Performance * Security (Denial of Service attacks)  as the number of Links cannot exceed this limit. |

This is summarized in the table below.

| Team Multiplicity | Employee Multiplicity | Notation in Documentation | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unbounded | unbounded | n:n | There is no limit on the number of Team documents that may be linked to a single Employee document. This means, each employee may be in an unlimited number of teams.  There is no limit on the number of Employee documents that may be linked to a single Team document. This means, each team may have an unlimited number of employees. |

### Step 2: Model the Document and Form Models

![Text step2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step2.png)

Figure 7. Employee\_DM

Now that we know what we’re going to do, we need to create the Document and Form Models for employees and teams.
This should be done using the Simple Model Editor using the skills you learned in the Fundamentals training.

* Model Document Models for the employee and team.

You can add as many fields as you like to the Document Models.
The fields that will be used in this tutorial are shown in the table below.

| Fields on Team\_DM | Fields on Employee\_DM |
| --- | --- |
| Name (String) | FirstName (String) |
| Location (String) | LastName (String) |
|  | JobTitle (String) |
|  | StartDate (Date) |

* Model a Form Model for each Document Model.
* Model save and cancel buttons at the bottom of the Form.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

Employee\_DM, Team\_DM, Employee\_FM, Team\_FM

Figure 11. Preview of Team\_FM

### Step 3: Create the Additional Link Field Models

![Text step3](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step3.png)

Figure 12. TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM

To be able to add the joining date for each employee to each team, we need a further Document Model and Form Model for this data.
In this use-case, we are only going to add one field JoinedTeamOn, to hold the joining date.

We strongly advise using the
[Model Naming Conventions](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/model_naming_conventions/index.html).
This means that you will be able to easily find models relating to the relationship.

We are going to call this model for the Additional Link Fields, TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM.
This is based on the convention Relationship\_LinkFields\_DM.

* Model the Document Model (TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM).
* Model the Form Model (TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_FM).
* Once again, please add save and cancel buttons to the bottom of the form.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Please ensure that the "Save" button uses the event, "event\_submit", so that the popup window closes after saving the data. |

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM, TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_FM

### Step 4: Create the Relationship Model

##### Create the Relationship Model

![Text step4a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step4a.png)

Figure 15. Create the Relationship Model

* Click on "ADD" in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Relationship Model".
* Complete the Folder, Name, locales and roles and click "OK".

Once again, we’re going to use the naming convention from the
[Model Naming Conventions](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/model_naming_conventions/index.html)
so that the Relationship Model is called TeamEmployee.

##### Add Related Entities

![Text step4b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step4b.png)

Figure 16. Add the Team role to Related Entities

The first step is to add the roles to the "Related Entities" section.

* Click on the "Add" button.
* Enter "Team" in both the "Label" and "Role" fields.
* Select the Team\_DM Document Model using the drop-down menu and check the "unbounded" checkbox to set the multiplicity.
* This role is now complete so click "Add" / "Apply".
* Click "Add" to complete the second role using the Employee\_DM Document Model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You could also set an explicit upper limit for the Multiplicity as mentioned in [Step 1](#step1) |

##### Add the Link Document Model

![Text step4c](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step4c.png)

Figure 17. Add the Link Document Model

Link Document Models can be added using the drop-down labelled "Link Document Model Reference".
This field is used to select the Document Model that we created in [Step 3](#step3).

* Select TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM from the list.

##### Generate Document Models

![Text step4d](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step4d.png)

Figure 18. Generate Document Models

We now need to generate some Document Models to allow the relationship to work correctly. The Simple Model Editor does this for us automatically, but you need to save the Relationship Model first.

* Save the Relationship Model.

The "Generate Document Models" button in the bottom left-hand corner is now active.

* Click "Generate Document Models" button to create the additional Document Models.
* Select a folder for these models and click "Continue".

Two Document Models will be created with names according to the following convention, Relationship\_Role\_\_\_generated.
In our case, the Document Models are called TeamEmployee\_Team\_\_\_generated and TeamEmployee\_Employee\_\_\_generated.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you make any changes to the relationship after you have generated these Document Models, you should:  * Save the Relationship Model. * Re-use the "Generate Document Models" button.  This will make sure that the additional Document Models required for the relationship are up-to-date. |

##### Note on Modeling Multiplicity

Please note, if you are modeling relationships with a different multiplicity, e.g. 1, you should leave the "unbounded" checkbox blank.
Instead, enter the upper limit for the multiplicity in the field to the left of the checkbox.
In the case of a role with multiplicity = 1, you would simply enter 1 in this field.

It is generally recommended to model an explicit upper limit for the multiplicity as this can improve performance and prevent security issues.
This means modeling, for example, a 10:999 relationship instead of an unbounded n:n relationship.

The modeling of a Drop Down Selection which is recommended for maintaining links to a role with multiplicity = 1 is then covered in [Step 5c](#step5c).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A *Link Document Model* can only be used in an *n:n* relationship |

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

TeamEmployee, TeamEmployee\_Team\_\_\_generated, TeamEmployee\_Employee\_\_\_generated

Figure 22. TeamEmployee after saving, Generate Document Models button is enabled and has been clicked to generate TeamEmployee\_Team\_\_\_generated and TeamEmployee\_Employee\_\_\_generated

### Step 5: Create the Binding in the Form Model

As discussed in, ["What Does a Relationship Model Look Like in the UI"](#What_does_a_relationships_UI), Bindings are used to configure the relationship UI components to display and maintain the links between Document Models.
Bindings are added and positioned in the Form Model.

There are different UI components that can be used and the best choice depends on:

* The type of relationship you have
* If you want the user to be able to edit the links
* How you want the information presented

The UI components are summarized in the table below.

| UI Component | Recommended for Target Role of Multiplicity | Description | Planned Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Drop Down Selection | 1 | Set a link to a single document from a drop-down list of all available documents. |  |
| Dual Pane Selection | >1 | Set (multiple) links to documents from a list of all available documents. Linked documents are then shown in a second pane. | Use on Employee\_FM to select teams |
| Table List |  | A read only view of the linked document(s). |  |
| Table List with Dual Pane Selection | >1 | Adding a Dual Pane Selection to a Table List adds an Edit button at the bottom of the Table List. This button opens a Dual Pane Selection to allow the user to maintain the links. | Use on Team\_FM to view and select employees |

As our relationship is an n:n relationship, we will model the two UI components for multiplicity > 1.
We will model a Dual Pane Selection for the Employee\_FM Form Model and a Table List with Dual Pane Selection for the Team\_FM Form Model.

#### Step 5a: Binding on Employee\_FM

##### Create Binding

![Text step5a](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5a.png)

Figure 23. Create TeamEmployee\_Binding

Bindings are added in the Simple Model Editor within a Form Model by drag-and-drop or by selecting a Binding in the context menu.
If the Document Model, on which the current Form Model is based, is referenced in a Relationship Model, this Relationship Model will be listed in the "Relationships" section on the right-hand side of the Simple Model Editor.

* Open the Employee\_FM Form Model.
* Decide which screen or section the relationship UI component should appear on.
* Expand the "Relationships" section of "Data Models" on the right-hand side of the Simple Model Editor.
* Drag and drop the Relationship "TeamEmployee" into the screen or section of your choice.

A Binding is added to the Form Model with the default name, TeamEmployee\_Binding.
If you open the Binding Editor by clicking on TeamEmployee\_Binding, you will see that the Relationship and Target Role are automatically completed.
In this case, the Relationship, "TeamEmployee" and Target Role, "Team" are selected.

The Binding Editor will now open on the right-hand side of the Simple Model Editor.

###### Add Component

We want to use a Dual Pane Selection on Employee\_FM to allow teams to be selected.

* Select Dual Pane Selection from the drop-down list "Component Type".

###### Add Additional Link Fields Form

![Text step5b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5b.png)

Figure 24. Add TeamEmployee\_LinkField\_FM as the Additional Link Fields Form

The next step is to select the additional Form Model from [Step 3](#step3).

* Select TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_FM in the drop-down menu, "Additional Link Fields Form"

##### Create Available Items Overview

![Text step5c](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5c.png)

Figure 25. Create Available Items Overview Model

We now need to create simplified overviews that we can use to view and select the items.

* Click the "+Add" button on the right of the Available Items Overview.
  (This button is a "+" button in the new Binding Editor.)

This opens a specialized version of the Overview Model Editor, which we will use to add columns, just like columns are added to any overview.
The Document Model, "Team\_DM", is pre-selected based on the "Target Role".

* Add both the Name and Location fields to the columns by clicking on "Add" and selecting the correct "element reference".
* Switch to the Models Settings tab.
* Ensure that the roles we’ve chosen for the Form Model are added to this overview as well.

You can model various other settings that will be applied to the Dual Pane Selection later on, but for now, we will leave these settings.

* Click "Save" to save this Available Items Overview and close the editor.

This creates a new overview model called TeamEmployee\_Team\_AvailableItems\_OM.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Overview Models used in Bindings have a round icon and are decorated with a small "Re" in the Workspace Explorer.  These Overview Models will always have restricted functionality and therefore should not be re-used in other contexts. |

##### Create Selected Items Overview

![Text step5d](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5d.png)

Figure 26. Create Selected Items Overview Model

We can now repeat this process for the Selected Items Overview. The "Relationship\_Role\_\_\_generated" Document Models that we generated in [Step 4](#step4) are referenced in the Selected Items Overview.

As \*\_\*\_\_\_generated Document Models combine fields from the individual roles with the Link Fields, fields from both target role (Team\_DM) and the Link Document Model (TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_DM) can be referenced in the Selected Items Overview.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The \*\_\*\_\_\_generated Document Models are not used in the backend and simply support modeling Bindings with data from Link Documents. |

* Click the "+Add" button on the right of the Selected Items Overview.
  ("+" button in the new Binding Editor.)
* Add the same 2 columns that we used in the Available Items Overview (Name and Location).
* Switch to the Models Settings tab.
* Ensure that the roles we’ve chosen for the Form Model are added to this overview as well.

These are the models that you created in this step:

TeamEmployee\_Team\_AvailableItems\_OM, TeamEmployee\_Team\_SelectedItems\_OM,

#### Step 5b: Binding on Team\_FM

##### Create Binding

![Text step5e](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5e.png)

Figure 29. Create TeamEmployee\_Binding

We now need to add a Binding to Team\_FM.
Once again, we will add this Binding by drag-and-drop.
But this time, we will add a Table List with Dual Pane Selection as the relationship UI element. In the Binding Editor we will select Table List as component type and then set the switch "Has Edit Modal" to "yes".

* Open the Team\_FM Form Model.
* Decide which screen or section the relationship UI component should appear on.
* Expand the "Relationships" section of "Data Models" on the right-hand side of the Simple Model Editor.
* Drag and Drop the relationship "TeamEmployee" into the screen or section of your choice.

A Binding is added to the Form Model with the default name, TeamEmployee\_Binding.
If you open the Binding Editor by clicking on TeamEmployee\_Binding, you will see that the Relationship and Target Role are automatically completed.
In this case, the Relationship, "TeamEmployee" and Target Role, "Employee" are selected.

##### Add Component

![Text step5f](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step5f.png)

Figure 30. Add Table List component with edit modal

This Binding is now modeled by adding the Table List component and then setting the switch, "Has Edit Modal" to "yes".

The updated layout of the editor means that you will now have the option to add all 3 overviews that you require.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Overviews and Additional Field Form Model selection are displayed in the following order in the Binding Editor  * Selected Items Overview (for the Table List) * Additional Link Fields Form (editable in the Dual Pane) * Available Items Overview (for the Dual Pane) * Selected Items Overview (for the Dual Pane) |

* Model a new Selected Items Overview using the "+" button on the right-hand side.
* Add the FirstName, LastName and JoinedTeamOn fields as columns to this overview as well so that we can see these 3 fields in this Table List.
* Click "Save".
* Select the additional Form Model from [Step 3](#step3) (TeamEmployee\_LinkFields\_FM).
* Create a new Available Items Overview for the Dual Pane Selection using the "+" button on the right-hand side.
* Add the FirstName and LastName fields to this overview.
* Click "Save".
* Re-use the Selected Items Overview that you just created by selecting this in the drop-down.
* Click "Apply" to finish editing the Binding.
* Save the Form Model.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

TeamEmployee\_Employee\_AvailableItems\_OM, TeamEmployee\_Employee\_SelectedItems\_OM

Figure 32. Team Form with TeamEmployee\_Binding

#### Step 5c: Bindings with a Drop Down Selection

In Steps [5a](#step5a) and [5b](#step5b), we modeled the Dual Pane Selection and the Table List with a Dual Pane Selection.
If we had a different use-case, then it may be more appropriate to model a Drop Down Selection.
As you can see from the Table at the start of [Step 5](#step5), this is the recommended relationship UI component when the target role has a multiplicity of one.

The process of modeling a Drop Down Selection on a Form Model is very similar to the process explained in [Step 5a](#step5a).

##### Add Drop Down Selection

* Create the Binding and select the relationship and target role from the drop-down menus.

Please consider the multiplicity of the target role, as we’re modeling a Drop Down Selection, we should choose a target role with a multiplicity of one.

* Click on the "Add" button in the "Components" section and then choose "Drop Down Selection" from the drop-down menu.

The subsequent steps are then as described in [Step 5a](#step5a).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Drop Down Selections will only show one column (the first column) from the Available Items and Selected Items Overviews. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | An expression column combining multiple field values may be modeled. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Take care to test expression columns carefully as the search functionality of the autocomplete widget is based on data in the document and **does not** use the output of the expression. |

### Step 6: Create the Overview Models

##### Create Team Overview

![Text step6](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step6.png)

Figure 33. Create Team overview

Before we finish, we need to create Overview Models to add new and list existing employees and teams.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Overview Models used in Bindings have a round icon and are decorated with a small "Re" in the Workspace Explorer.  These Overview Models will always have restricted functionality and therefore should not be re-used in other contexts. |

* Click on "Add" in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Overview Model".
* Complete the Folder, Name, Locales and Roles and click "OK".
* Select Team\_DM from the Document Model drop-down.
* Add the columns to the overview. Let’s create two columns from fields we modeled in [Step 2](#step2), Name and Location.
* Switch to the Custom Actions tab and add a delete row action and an add button to the minor subheader section.
* Save the Overview.

##### Create Employee Overview

![Text step6b](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step6b.png)

Figure 34. Create Employee overview Model

* Repeat the process for the Employee overview.
* Let’s add 3 columns First Name, Last Name and Job Title.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

Team\_OM, Employee\_OM

![Step6 1 Teams](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Step6_1_Teams.png)

![Step6 2 Employees](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Step6_2_Employees.png)

Figure 36. Employee\_OM

### Step 7: Use Master Detail Module Models to Create the Modules

![Text step7](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/modeling_tutorial_relationships/assets/Text_step7.png)

Figure 37. Create Employee Master Detail Module Model

You’re now ready to add each Overview Model to a new module.

* Click on Add in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Master Detail Module Model".
* Complete the Folder, Name, Locales and Roles and click "OK".
* Use the drop-down menu to select the Overview Model we just created in [Step 6](#step6).
* The Document Models are already added to the Form Mapping section.
  You simply need to select the correct Form Model from the drop-down menu for each Document Model.
* You also need to navigate to the Model Settings tab and enter a label in the Main Menu Label section.
* Repeat the process for the second Overview Model.

The Master Detail Module models can now be added to the App Model.

* Click on the PreviewApp\_AM and navigate to the Model Settings tab.
* Click on the Add button in the Model References section at the bottom.
* Select "module-masterdetail" and the Team\_MDM model that we just created using the two drop down menus.
* Click on the add button again to add the Employee\_MDM.
* Save the model and you’re finished!

You can now test your models to make sure that everything is working perfectly.
Remember, that Master Detail Module Models are only added to the Preview App, if the App Model or the whole workspaces is deployed from the Simple Model Editor.

**Click here to see what your project should look like by now.**

These are the models that you created in this step:

Team\_MDM, Employee\_MDM

Figure 39. Employee\_MDM

## How to Test and Troubleshoot Your Models

* Start your workspace using the Preview App Control and log in (admin:a12).
* Connect the Simple Model Editor to the server using the "Configure Server Connection" tab in the top right-hand corner (admin:a12).
* Deploy your workspace and refresh your browser tab.
* Click on the Teams module in your application and add some teams.
* Once you have created Team 1 and Team 2 in the Teams module, you can create employees and add them to teams using the Dual Pane Selection in the Employees detail view.

We can then enter the information we need to match the schema in the use-case. This is shown in the three screenshots below.

## Glossary

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ***1:n* relationship** | A *1:n* relationship is a relationship in which one role has the upper limit of 1 as multiplicity, while the other role has a multiplicity >1 or an unbounded multiplicity. |
| ***n:n* relationship** | An *n:n* relationship is a relationship in which both roles have a multiplicity >1 or an unbounded multiplicity. |
| **Binding** | Used to integrate relationship UI components into the form engine. The binding allows a UI for linking documents to a single "main" document to be modeled. |
| **Candidate** | Refers to the set of instances to which a link could be created. As of now, it is "all" the instances of the target role’s Document Model to which no link exists yet. Synonym to "Available Items". |
| **Drop Down Selection** | A relationship UI component, the best suitable if the target role has a multiplicity with an upper limit of 1. |
| **Dual Pane Selection** | A relationship UI component, the best suitable if the target role has multiplicity with an upper limit ≥ 2 or unbounded. |
| **Duplicable** | When Duplicable is selected, multiple links of the same type between the same two documents are allowed. |
| **Generated Document Model** | Relationship-specific Document Models that need to be generated using the Relationship Model Editor. They are used in the Overview Models for relationship UI components for the Selected Items Overview. |
| **Link** | An instance of a Relationship Model; specifies the connection between an instance of one role of the relationship and an instance of the other role of the relationship. |
| **Link Constraints** | Properties of a relationship role; currently limited to multiplicity. |
| **Link Order** | The order in which links are displayed in the tree engine or relationship UI elements. |
| **Multiplicity** | Specifies the maximum number of instances of this role that can be linked to one instance of the other role; can be a number (upper limit) or unbounded. |
| **Orderable** | When Orderable is selected, links that are displayed in a tree engine can be reordered manually in the UI. The links are shown in the same order in other relationship UI components. |
| **Relationship Model** | Determines which Document Models are connected due to a business requirement. Their roles and multiplicity as well as the reference to a Link Document Model containing Additional Link Fields are maintained in the Relationship Model as well. |
| **Role** | The role is used to identify the part that a document plays in the link to another document. |
| **Self-Referencing Relationship** | Both roles are taken up by the same Document Model, thus making it possible to create links between instances of one Document Model. |
| **Table List** | A relationship UI element in which links are displayed; read-only. |
| **Target Role** | A setting for the relationship UI elements maintained in the Binding Editor that determines which role of the links is shown and edited. |
| **Unbounded** | The multiplicity of a role is unbounded if the maximum number of instances of this role that can be linked to one instance of the other role is unlimited. |
| **Upper Limit** | Specifies the maximum number of instances of this role that can be linked to one instance of the other role. |
| **Relationship UI Component** | UI element in which relationship links can be edited and/or displayed: Drop Down Selection, Dual Pane Selection and Table List |
