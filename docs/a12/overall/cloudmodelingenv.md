# Cloud Modeling Environment

This documentation is intended for a business analyst audience. Prior knowledge of the Simple Model Editor and the Preview Application is assumed.

|  | You must have an account on geta12.com with respective rights to use the Cloud Modeling Environment. |

## Introduction & Terminology

Instead of a local installation of the Modeling Environment, we offer a cloud-based solution for accessing our key modeling tools. This includes both the Simple Model Editor and the Preview Application. They can be accessed by the Cloud Modeling Control, which is an administrative view which enables the user to start Cloud Modeling Environment Workspaces. The following is a guide to setting up and using a Cloud Modeling Environment Workspace, short CME-Workspace.

Although the tools are available in the browser, it is still necessary to have locally stored models to work with in the SME.

The `Sample Workspaces` can be used as a starting point for modeling. Please download them from [geta12.com](https://geta12.com/#/releases/sample-workspaces).

### Workspaces

For the Cloud Modeling Environment, the term "workspace" is used in two different contexts. A single CME-Workspace contains both, a SME and a Preview Application. Starting, stopping or deleting a CME-Workspace, will start, stop or delete the corresponding instances of the SME and the Preview Application. A `Sample Workspace` or `SME Workspace` is a set of files that is considered to be the content of the Preview Application and contains editable models to work with in the SME.
During modeling, models are not stored in the CME-Workspace. Instead, as mentioned above, the SME loads and saves model files directly from the user’s local file system.

## Use Case

The Cloud Modeling Environment is to be treated as a Demo and is available as Software as a Service with a corresponding login. Details about this can also be found in the "Terms of use for the demo environment of the Cloud Modeling Environment".

The goal is to enable mgm’s pre-sales colleagues to prepare and present a fully modeled pre-sales application. The prepared Cloud Modeling Environment Workspace can be handed over to the interested party, who can then access the modeling tools and view and modify the models. With the Cloud Modeling Environment, this can be done without installing anything. This demo is therefore not limited by the constraints of the IT environment.

|  | For sharing and versioning of A12 models / `SME Workspaces` we recommend the use of common version control systems such as git. |

## Get Started

For accessing the Cloud Modeling Control (<https://cme.playground.mgm-tp.com/>) you will need to log in with the cloud modeling account and arrive at the following view.

![Create New CME-Workspace View](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/cloudmodelingenv/assets/images/EclipseChe_create_new.png)

Figure 1. Create New CME-Workspace View

The 5 tiles offer a selection of the possible starting points based on `Sample Workspaces` available on getA12. Please select one by clicking on the tile.

Figure 2. Progress of Starting the new CME-Workspace

As a result, the CME-Workspace will be initialised and when the process is complete, the SME will open.

|  |  |

|  | The supported browsers for the SME are Chrome (Windows, MacOS), edge (Windows) and Chromium (Ubuntu). |

At the same time, the Preview App server and client will start and its content is determined by the selected `Sample Workspace`. Please be aware that the Preview App takes some time to start up. You can access the running Preview App client by copying the URL of the Simple Model Editor, which looks like:

```
https://cme.playground.mgm-tp.com/userID/CME-WorkspaceID/7000/
```

And change the port `7000` to `7001`:

```
https://cme.playground.mgm-tp.com/userID/CME-WorkspaceID/7001/
```

The SME can be connected to the running Preview App server via the same URL with `/api` added:

```
https://cme.playground.mgm-tp.com/userID/CME-WorkspaceID/7001/api
```

The `userID` is displayed on the top right and the `CME-WorkspaceID` is listed in the menu item "Workspaces" or is also to be found in the sidebar of the Cloud Modeling Control mentioned as "Recent Workspaces". The information is also to be found in the already opened SME URL.

Figure 4. Example Configuration for Server Connection in SME

As soon as the SME is connected to the Preview App Server you deploy the models. The models can be based on a `Sample Workspace` or a completely different workspace. Be careful with modifications that have an effect on documents already present. At the moment the Cloud Modeling Environment does not offer any database control, hence a deletion of the Preview App database is not possible.

Figure 5. Working with the SME in the Cloud Modeling Environment

At the moment it is only possible to have one running CME-Workspace. If you decide to initialise your Cloud Modeling Environment based on a different `Sample Workspace`, it is necessary to delete the current one and create a new one with the respective starting point.

For deleting the currently running one return to the overview of CME-Workspaces. The option to delete is to be found in the three-dot-menu on the very right.

![Deleting the Current CME-Workspace](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/cloudmodelingenv/assets/images/EclipseChe_delete_workspace.png)

Figure 6. Deleting the Current CME-Workspace.

The deletion has to be confirmed. The locally stored models are not affected by this.
