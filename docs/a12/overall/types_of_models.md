# Types of Models

Several different types of model are available in A12:

* [Document Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html)
* [Relationship Model](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/relationships_for_bas/index.html)
* [Form Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-fm-ba-docs/index.html)
* [Content Model](https://geta12.com/docs/content_engine/contentengine-user-docs/index.html)
* [Overview Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-om-ba-docs/index.html)
* [Tree Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-tm-ba-docs/index.html)
* [App Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-am-ba-docs/index.html)
* [Print Model](https://geta12.com/docs/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/index.html) & [Print Setting Model](https://geta12.com/docs/print_engine/print-modeling-documentation/index.html#PrintSetting)

Below you can find some very high-level explanations of these models.
Please note that this list is not complete. Refer to further documentation in this section for more details about the different model types.

## Document Model

The Document Model forms the foundation of the entire application. The domain expert maps out the entire business domain within it, so the Document Model describes the entities belonging to your business application. An example of a business entity might be a company or an employee. The Document Model for each of these entities would contain all fields associated with that entity. Those fields can be organised hierarchically in groups. In more technical terms, Document Models contain specifications of fields, data types, computation and validation rules.

![DataModel](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/DataModel.png)

Figure 1. Document Model

The [Kernel Language](https://geta12.com/docs/kernel/kernel-documentation-ba-en/index.html) can be used to express computations and validation rules. This validation may be as simple as setting a field to mandatory or as complex as applying intricate patterns and conditions across multiple fields.

A12 provides different approaches to reuse existing business logic:
[Type Definitions](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-dm-ba-docs/index.html#_type_definition_model) can be used to specify common data types, Includes allow to reuse complete sets of groups, fields and rules and [Combination Modeling](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-cmm-ba-docs/index.html) allows to add a set of fields and rules to different Document Models in a systematic way.

Document Models are built in the Document Model Editor in the SME and saved as JSON files. The Document Model Editor facilitates the definition of data structures, validation rules, and computations. For conveniently adding and modifying validation criteria, the editor features "autocomplete" and "syntax highlighting" for the Kernel Language.

## Relationship Model

The Relationship Model describes the relationship between two entities, hence Document Models. You can describe the relationship, for example whether it is of type 1:n, n:n etc. You can add captions that will be used when the relationship data is displayed and also specify Document Models that contain additional link fields that will be associated with that relationship link between particular documents of the entities.

The Relationship Model is created and edited in the Simple Model Editor and saved as a JSON file.

The SME also offers the feature of creating a Model Graph Diagram in the so-called Data Modeling Perspective, which visualizes the relationships within the workspace.

![Relationship](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/Relationship.png)

Figure 2. Model Graph Diagram and Relationship Model

## Form Model

The Form Model is one of the UI models available in A12, and it can be used to display details or fields from one instance of an entity. The Form Model Editor is used to create Form Models, and they are stored as JSON files.

![FormModelInFMM](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/FormModelInFMM.png)

Figure 3. Form Model in the Form Model Editor

The Form Model Editor pursues a rather abstract but very powerful way of modeling user interfaces. Instead of diving into design specifics like colors, margins, and spacing, the editor focuses on the organization of UI elements. Instead of letting the user put input fields, radio buttons, or text labels directly on screen in a WYSIWYG style, it operates with hierarchical lists of model elements. This modeling philosophy enables business experts to focus on their domain and model complete user interfaces on their own. The graphical presentation is completely decoupled and is not specified within the Form Model Editor. In order to provide an attractive and modern design out of the box, A12 makes use of Plasma Design—a coherent design concept for business applications developed by mgm that is capable of applying various themes.

![FormModelInApp](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/FormModelInApp.png)

Figure 4. Form Model in an application

Each Form Model refers to at least one Document Model. This is a crucial aspect for understanding the design philosophy of the Form Model Editor—and the main difference from classical GUI builders. There is no point in creating UI models without corresponding Document Models. You can think of UI models as a kind of wrapper around selected parts of your Document Models. They provide the frame for user interaction based on a selection of your data fields. Due to this connection, the Document Model and its accompanying validation rules are usually created first. As soon as this has been done, new UI models with a reference to this Document Model can be created. Data and validation definitions take center stage in A12.

## Content Model

With the Content Model static pages can be created and embedded in your application, e.g. in the sample workspaces as welcome page. It’s editor offers both, a model tree displaying the nested model elements as well as a canvas with a visual representation of the model elements and WYSIWYG editing options for the modeler.

![title:"Content Model Editor"](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/ContentModel.png)

Like the other model types, the Simple Model Editor stores this as a JSON file.

## Overview Model

The Overview Model is another example of a UI model that is available. Like the Form Model, it is based on at least one Document Model, it is created in the Simple Model Editor and is stored as a JSON file.

![OverviewModelInApp](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/OverviewModelInApp.png)

Figure 5. Overview Model in an application

The Overview Model is used to display lists of entity instances or documents.
The Overview Model can be modeled to allow filtering, sorting, column pinning, row actions, and context menus.

By referencing a [Query Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-qm-ba-docs/index.html), modelers can limit the documents that are listed.
This can take the data of the respective document, existing links to other documents or their data into account.

## Tree Model

The Tree Model is a UI model which focuses on showing lists of data in a hierarchical structure based on relationships between the entities. Within a tree these entities are called node types. While forms are mainly used to acquire data from users, business applications often contain some sort of hierarchical table for presenting selected aspects of datasets in an orderly fashion like shown in the image below. This is exactly what the Tree Model is intended for.

![TreeExample](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/TreeExample.png)

Figure 6. Tree Model in an application

The Tree Model can be modeled to allow node type actions and context menus.

## Application Model

The Application Model is used to model the application that will contain your forms, trees and overviews. In the Application Model you can set up the layout of your application, e.g. Master/Detail - showing a list of documents in an overview or tree, when one is selected its details are displayed in a form on the right side of the screen.

Using the Application Model, you can add new modules to your application referencing the data and UI models that you created. The Application Model is edited using the Simple Model Editor and is saved as a JSON file.

### Master Detail Module Model

In the Modeling Environment modelers can use a shortcut to create a Master Detail Module using this model type. With it you specify the respective models to be used, e.g. the overview you want to show in the module and the associated document model and form model will be picked up. The Master Detail Module Model has to be referenced in the PreviewApp’s App Model.

![MasterDetail](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/MasterDetail.png)

Figure 7. Master Detail Module

Find details about this special model type in the comprehensive features chapter: [Master Detail Module Model](https://geta12.com/docs/sme/sme-mdmm-ba-docs/index.html).

## Print Model and Print Setting Model

### Print Model

Print Models offer a way to generate PDF documents from data processed by applications built on the A12 platform. Print Models describe the layout, styling, and content of the resulting PDF document(s).

You can use the Print Model Editor within the SME to create Print Models, and save them as JSON files within your workspace. You can reference a Document Model in your Print Model and make use of its fields and groups in order to create a blueprint of the PDF files you want to generate. Key features of a Print Model include:

1. Content Definition

   Includes elements like text, images, tables, lists, headers, and footers.
   Supports both static content and dynamic data bindings from the A12 platform.
2. Styling and Layout

   Allows customization of fonts, colors, alignment, borders, and spacing.
   Defines page properties such as size, orientation, and margins.
3. Dynamic Behavior

   Supports advanced features like conditional visibility of specific elements, element repetition, and calculations.
   Enables rule-based content generation (by making use of the A12 Kernel Language) and dynamic layouts.
4. Standards Compliance

   Ensures generated PDFs conform to standards like PDF/A-3a (archival) and PDF/UA (accessibility).

![PrintModel](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/types_of_models/assets/PrintModel.png)

Figure 8. Print Model Editor in the SME

The Print Model acts as a reusable blueprint, enabling developers and domain experts to create consistent, professional, and standards-compliant PDF documents efficiently.

### Print Setting Model

In the Print Setting Model, you can determine some global settings, such as fonts, which are then applicable to all of your Print Models within the workspace. Therefore, there can only be one Print Settings Model per workspace.
