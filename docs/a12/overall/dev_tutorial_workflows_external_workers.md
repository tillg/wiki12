# Task 2 - External Worker Implementation

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Workflows > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_workflows_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/workflows/task-2-start** to follow along.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/workflows/task-2-end** to see differences between both implementations.

## Use Case

Implement the "Generate Gift Card" external worker for the Customer Onboarding Process.

This external worker will demonstrate how to create asynchronous task handlers that can handle resource-intensive operations and can be scaled independently of the workflow engine.

## End Result

Upon finishing this task, you will know:

* How to implement and test external workers
* Benefits and drawbacks of external workers

  + Performance considerations and others

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Understanding External Workers

External workers allow service tasks that:

* **Run outside the process engine**: Better isolation and scalability
* **Handle CPU-intensive operations**: Don’t block the engine
* **Enable horizontal scaling**: Multiple worker instances can process tasks
* **Polyglot programming**: External task client apps can be implemented in any language (although CIB 7 only provides starters for Java and Spring Boot)

**Key Concepts:**

* **External Task**: A service task configured with `external` implementation
* **Worker**: Application that polls for and handles external tasks
* **Topic**: Named queue that connects tasks to workers
* **Lock**: An external task is locked (for a configurable duration) once fetched by a worker

### Implementing the Gift Card Generation Worker

The "Generate Gift Card" worker needs to:

1. Poll for gift card generation tasks
2. Generate a gift card code
3. Store gift card code back to the process

#### External Tasks

External task clients run outside the engine. CIB 7 provides starters for pure Java, pure Spring, and Spring Boot. We recommend using the Spring Boot starter to create a service responsible for gift card generation.

The service task in BPMN is modeled as follows:

![external task bpmn properties](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_workflows_external_workers/assets/external-task-bpmn-properties.png)

**The topic name is `GENERATE_GIFT_CARD`.** The external task handler must subscribe to this exact topic.

#### Admin UI

Remember you can visit `http://localhost:8088/camunda/` to observe process execution for debugging.

#### CIB 7 vs Camunda

Being a fork of Camunda 7, CIB 7 still has relics of that naming. For instance, the configuration properties you will need still use `camunda` as prefix. In the URL above, `/camunda` is intentional because it leads to the legacy Camunda Admin UI.

Your task:

* Set up a **new worker app** using Spring Boot and the CIB 7 External Task Client starter.

  + Call the new module `generate-gift-card-external-worker`.
  + Implement an external task handler.

    - Subscribe to the topic `GENERATE_GIFT_CARD`.
    - The gift gard code should have the format `VIP-<some-uuid>`.
* Unit test the task handler logic in your new worker app.
* Bonus: Test the service task setup in the BPMN model via the CIB 7 Testing API.

  + This is done in the `workflow-engine` module.
* Manually integration-test via the Admin UI.

Use the following resources to complete this task:

* To implement the External Worker app:

  + [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to initialize a new Spring Boot app
  + [CIB 7 > External Task Client Spring Boot](https://docs.cibseven.org/manual/latest/user-guide/ext-client/spring-boot-starter/)

    - You only need the dependency in the intro, the brief topic subscription section, and the basic client configuration.
* To test the service task setup:

  + [CIB 7 > Testing API for External Tasks](https://docs.cibseven.org/manual/latest/user-guide/testing/assert-examples/#completing-external-tasks-and-passing-process-variables)
  + [Camunda > SimpleTestCase.java](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-engine-unittest/blob/master/src/test/java/org/camunda/bpm/unittest/SimpleTestCase.java) template (there is also `externalTask(…​)` equivalent to `task(…​)`)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In the external task client configuration, you will need the following property to conform to the A12 datetime format: `camunda.bpm.client.date-format=yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm`. |

Hints

**Dependencies**

Your External Task Client app will need dependencies along the lines of:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` dependencies {     implementation libs.cibseven.external.task.client     implementation libs.jaxb.api  // jaxb-api:jakarta.xml.bind:4.0.1      developmentOnly libs.spring.boot.devtools     annotationProcessor libs.spring.boot.configuration.processor      testImplementation testCatalogLibs.spring.boot.starter.test } ``` |
```

**Testing**

The task handler test is a regular unit test and doesn’t need the CIB 7 Testing API. You can use mocking frameworks like Mockito to mock the `ExternalTask` and `ExternalTaskService` interfaces and verify on them:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` var mockExternalTaskService = mock(ExternalTaskService.class); var mockExternalTask = mock(ExternalTask.class); ``` |
```

---

To use JUnit 5, make sure to configure the `test` task accordingly in `build.gradle`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` tasks.named('test') {     useJUnitPlatform() } ``` |
```

**External Worker Spring Boot App**

File: `settings.gradle`

Include the new module:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` include 'generate-gift-card-external-worker' ``` |
```

Add required dependencies to the Gradle version catalog:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` // def springBootVersion = '3.4.5'... def cibsevenVersion = '2.0.0'  // ... libs { version('cibseven', cibsevenVersion) version('jaxb','4.0.1')  library('cibseven-external-task-client', 'org.cibseven.bpm.springboot', 'cibseven-bpm-spring-boot-starter-external-task-client').versionRef('cibseven') library('jaxb-api', 'jakarta.xml.bind', 'jakarta.xml.bind-api').versionRef('jaxb')  // ... testCatalogLibs { version('cibseven', cibsevenVersion) library('cibseven-bpm-assert', 'org.cibseven.bpm', 'cibseven-bpm-assert').versionRef('cibseven') ``` |
```

File: `generate-gift-card-external-worker/build.gradle`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` plugins {     id 'java'     id 'application'     alias(gradlePluginLibs.plugins.spring.boot) }  springBoot {     mainClass = 'com.mgmtp.a12.workflows.tutorial.worker.generategiftcard.GenerateGiftCardExternalWorkerApplication' }  dependencies {     implementation libs.cibseven.external.task.client     implementation libs.jaxb.api      developmentOnly libs.spring.boot.devtools     annotationProcessor libs.spring.boot.configuration.processor      testImplementation testCatalogLibs.spring.boot.starter.test }  tasks.named('test') {     useJUnitPlatform() } ``` |
```

File: `generate-gift-card-external-worker/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/workflows/tutorial/worker/generategiftcard/GenerateGiftCardExternalWorkerApplication.java`

This file is unchanged from `start.spring.io`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.workflows.tutorial.worker.generategiftcard;  import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;  @SpringBootApplication public class GenerateGiftCardExternalWorkerApplication {      public static void main(String[] args) {         SpringApplication.run(GenerateGiftCardExternalWorkerApplication.class, args);     }  } ``` |
```

File: `generate-gift-card-external-worker/src/main/resources/application.properties`

Here, external task client configuration is placed as described in [the CIB 7 docs](https://docs.cibseven.org/manual/latest/user-guide/ext-client/spring-boot-starter/#configuration).

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` camunda.bpm.client.base-url=http://localhost:8088/engine-rest camunda.bpm.client.worker-id=generate-gift-card-worker camunda.bpm.client.basic-auth.username=admin camunda.bpm.client.basic-auth.password=admin # Required: A12 date format used by A12 Workflows Engine camunda.bpm.client.date-format=yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm ``` |
```

File: `workflow-engine/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties`

For simplicity, we extend UAA’s unsecured URLs to allow unauthenticated access to `/engine-rest/external-task/**` which will be used by external workers:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` # UAA # ... mgmtp.a12.uaa.authentication.unsecured.urls=<...>,/${spring.jersey.application-path}/external-task/** ``` |
```

File: `generate-gift-card-external-worker/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/workflows/tutorial/worker/generategiftcard/GenerateGiftCardHandler.java`

The gift card generator simply creates random gift codes of the form `VIP-<some-uuid>`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.workflows.tutorial.worker.generategiftcard;  import org.cibseven.bpm.client.spring.annotation.ExternalTaskSubscription; import org.cibseven.bpm.client.task.ExternalTask; import org.cibseven.bpm.client.task.ExternalTaskHandler; import org.cibseven.bpm.client.task.ExternalTaskService; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;  import java.util.Collections; import java.util.UUID;  @Configuration @ExternalTaskSubscription("GENERATE_GIFT_CARD") public class GenerateGiftCardHandler implements ExternalTaskHandler {      @Override     public void execute(ExternalTask externalTask, ExternalTaskService externalTaskService) {          String giftCardCode = "VIP-" + UUID.randomUUID();          externalTaskService.complete(externalTask, Collections.singletonMap("giftCardCode", giftCardCode));          LoggerFactory.getLogger(GenerateGiftCardHandler.class).info("Generated gift card: {}", giftCardCode);     } } ``` |
```

The handler completes the external task via `externalTaskService.complete` and passes back the gift card code which will be stored as a new process variable named `giftCardCode`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | At this point, you can run the new external worker app via its main class `GenerateGiftCardExternalWorkerApplication` and it will start generating gift codes. There may be a noticeable delay between reaching the task and it being processed by the worker. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that the process will fail because of the missing Java delegate in the subsequent service task. So the following incident in the Cockpit is expected for now: |

![cockpit expected incident](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_workflows_external_workers/assets/cockpit-expected-incident.png)

Next is the unit test for the gift card handler.

This unit test mocks the `ExternalTask` and `ExternalTaskService` interfaces to verify that the handler behaves as expected, i.e. it calls `externalTaskService.complete` with a `giftCardCode` variable.

File: `generate-gift-card-external-worker/src/test/java/com/mgmtp/a12/workflows/tutorial/worker/generategiftcard/GenerateGiftCardHandlerTest.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.workflows.tutorial.worker.generategiftcard;  import org.cibseven.bpm.client.task.ExternalTask; import org.cibseven.bpm.client.task.ExternalTaskService; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import org.mockito.ArgumentCaptor;  import java.util.Map;  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue; import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any; import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.eq; import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;  class GenerateGiftCardHandlerTest {      GenerateGiftCardHandler generateGiftCardHandler = new GenerateGiftCardHandler();      @Test     public void shouldGenerateValidGiftCardCode() {         // given         var mockExternalTaskService = mock(ExternalTaskService.class);         var mockExternalTask = mock(ExternalTask.class);         ArgumentCaptor<Map<String, Object>> variablesCaptor = ArgumentCaptor.captor();          doNothing().when(mockExternalTaskService).complete(eq(mockExternalTask), any());          // when         generateGiftCardHandler.execute(mockExternalTask, mockExternalTaskService);          // then         verify(mockExternalTaskService).complete(eq(mockExternalTask), variablesCaptor.capture());         String capturedCode = (String) variablesCaptor.getValue().get("giftCardCode");          assertNotNull(capturedCode);         assertTrue(capturedCode.startsWith("VIP-"));     } } ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In real scenarios, we recommend adding higher-level tests that verify the inter-service interaction. For instance, we did not test that the worker actually subscribes to the correct topic name (`GENERATE_GIFT_CARD`). This requires running the workflow engine and the external worker app (and Data Services if not mocked) via a tool like [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/). You will implement such a test in a later task for Java Delegates. |

### Recommendations

Consider the following aspects before using external workers.

* **Noticeable Latency:** Both the polling interval and network cause noticeable latency.

  + Finetuning configuration can improve this to some extent, but external worker performance in CIB 7 (and Camunda 7) is not great.
  + On the other hand, external workers can be scaled independently to handle very high loads. For instance, if you have millions of resource-intensive computations to run and need many replicas of the worker.
  + Thus, we currently recommend using external workers judiciously (if you must move load off the workflow engine) and prefer Java delegates or script tasks.
* **Testing:** Keep in mind that integration testing external tasks is more complex as it requires running multiple services.

## Conclusion

You have implemented and tested a simple external worker that handles asynchronous gift card generation.

**Key takeaways:**

* External workers enable asynchronous processing outside the process engine.
* External workers can be scaled horizontally for high-throughput scenarios.
* Consider network latency and use external workers judiciously.

If something does not seem right, or you got stuck at any point, you can just check out **2025.06-ext5/workflows/task-2-end** to see differences between both implementations.
