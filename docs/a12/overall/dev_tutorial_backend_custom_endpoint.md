# Task 4 - Custom Endpoint

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Backend > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-4-start** to follow along.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/backend/task-4-end** to see how your code and models differ from the solution.

## Use-Case

To enhance reporting capabilities, we are going to add a custom operation to handle an RPC request, specifically for retrieving a list of contacts based on defined criteria such as customer type, nationality and locale language.

This operation is essential for reporting purposes, enabling clients to obtain a customized list of contacts tailored to their needs.

## End Result

Upon finishing this task you will know:

* How to add a custom operation in the backend.
* How to process server-side RPC requests.
* How to use Data Services APIs.
* How to use a REST API Client for sending HTTP requests.

In the end, a request sent to the custom operation should yield a response similar to the following.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### How Operations Are Handled

You can find an overview of the existing RPC operations from Data Services in [Data Services > JSON-RPC 2.0 Core Operations](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#rpc-operations). These operations can be extended by providing additional custom operations to this endpoint.

To achieve this, it is generally only necessary to set up the following in a project:

* Create a Java class with a `@RemoteOperation` annotation and set its value `name` to the operation name you want to use.
* Add a public method called `rpc`.
* Add the operation name to the list `mgmtp.a12.dataservices.jsonRpc.allowedOperations` in `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties`. This whitelists the specific operation, allowing it to be accepted by Data Services.

See [Data Services > Custom Operations](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#extending-api-custom-operations) for more details.

### Developing Custom Operation

#### Already Provided Classes, Interfaces and Utilities

##### Constants

This class provides static string variables for referencing our Document Model name and paths.
These field and group paths will be used to retrieve values from the documents.

It has now been extended to include all Document Model field and group paths required for handling the contact report request.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/utils/Constants.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.utils;  //...  @NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE) public final class Constants {      public static final String CONTACT_MODEL_NAME = "Contact_DM";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_EMAIL_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/Email";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_FIRSTNAME_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/FirstName";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_LASTNAME_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/LastName";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_GENDER_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/Gender";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_NATIONALITY_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/Nationality";     public static final String CONTACT_PERSONALDATA_CUSTOMER_TYPE_PATH = "/Contact/PersonalData/CustomerType";     public static final String CONTACT_PHONES_PATH = "/Contact/Phones";     public static final String CONTACT_PHONES_PHONE_NUMBER_PATH = "/Contact/Phones/PhoneNumber";     public static final String CONTACT_PHONES_PHONE_TYPE_PATH = "/Contact/Phones/Type";     public static final String CONTACT_ADDRESS_PATH = "/Contact/Address";      //... } ``` |
```

##### Contact

This class will store and represent our contact related data. It is configured as a `Builder` for easier instantiation of the contact data for our report. It will be used for mapping the attributes of the contact entity to the corresponding Document Model fields.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/report/Contact.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.report;  //...  @Data @Builder public class Contact {      private String firstName;     private String lastName;     private String email;     private String gender;     private String nationality;     private String customerType;     @Singular     private List<Phone> phones;      @Data     @Builder     public static class Phone {         private String number;         private String type;     } } ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | As you might have noticed, the `Contact` class does not contain a variable for storing addresses. This omission is intentional, as adding address handling would increase implementation complexity without offering additional learning benefits.  The approach for handling addresses is quite similar to that of phone numbers. So, if you wish, you can extend the implementation to include address handling at the end. |

##### ContactReportOperation

This class will handle our custom RPC operation and forward it to our `ContactReportService`, which contains the actual logic for creating the report. It already provides the necessary configuration for receiving a `GET_CONTACT_REPORT` request.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/report/ContactReportOperation.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.report;  //...  /**  * This operation is similar to the "LIST_DOCUMENTS" operation, where it collects all the contact data based on the  * given params.  */ @Slf4j @RemoteOperation(name = GET_CONTACT_REPORT) @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class ContactReportOperation {      public static final String GET_CONTACT_REPORT = "GET_CONTACT_REPORT";      private final ContactReportService contactReportService;      /**      * Handles RPC calls to retrieve a list of contacts based on the specified customer type, nationality,      * and locale language.      *      * @param customerType   the type of the customer to filter by (e.g., "Individual", "Business").      * @param nationality    the nationality of the contacts to filter by (e.g., "German", "British").      * @param localeLanguage the language code used for localization; must be either "en" or "de".      * @return a list of {@link Contact} objects matching the specified criteria.      * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the localeLanguage is not "en" or "de".      */     public List<Contact> rpc(@NonNull @JsonRpcParam("customerType") String customerType,                              @NonNull @JsonRpcParam("nationality") String nationality,                              @NonNull @JsonRpcParam("localeLanguage") String localeLanguage) {         log.debug("{} called with parameters [customerType={}, nationality={}, localeLanguage={}]",                 GET_CONTACT_REPORT,                 customerType,                 nationality,                 localeLanguage         );          // Put your code here ...         return new ArrayList<>();     } } ``` |
```

##### ContactReportService

This class will contain the actual logic for processing the contact report request, providing the data set based on the received `customerType` and `nationality` criteria. It will query for the contact documents and map them to instances of our `Contact` class.

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/report/ContactReportService.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.tutorial.server.report;  //...  @Component @RequiredArgsConstructor public class ContactReportService {      private final QueryService queryService;     private final IDocumentRepository documentRepository;     private final DocumentModelServiceFactory documentModelServiceFactory;     private final IModelLoader<IDocumentModel> documentModelLoader;      /**      * Retrieves a list of contacts based on the specified customer type, nationality, and locale language.      *      * @param customerType   the type of the customer to filter by (e.g., "lead", "vip").      * @param nationality    the nationality of the contacts to filter by (e.g., "German", "British").      * @param localeLanguage the language code used for localization (e.g., "en", "de").      * @return a list of {@link Contact} objects matching the specified criteria.      */     public List<Contact> getContacts(String customerType, String nationality, String localeLanguage) {         // Put your code here ...         return new ArrayList<>();     }  } ``` |
```

All necessary beans have already been injected for the implementation, including:

* `QueryService`: Will be used for querying the documents.
* `IDocumentRepository`: Will be used to retrieve the documents from the persistent store.
* `DocumentModelServiceFactory`: Will be used to create an `IDocumentModelSearchService`, which will allow us to retrieve values from the `Contact_DM` Document Model.
* `IModelLoader<IDocumentModel>`: Will be used to load the Document Model, which contains the localized text values.

#### Adding the Property

The contact report operation is handled as a new RPC operation within the `ContactReportOperation` class, the operation name is defined as `GET_CONTACT_REPORT`. To enable this operation, we have to configure the allowed operations on server-side in the properties file.

Therefore, add `GET_CONTACT_REPORT` at the end of the list of the property `mgmtp.a12.dataservices.jsonRpc.allowedOperations`.

File: `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` #...  # Security mgmtp.a12.dataservices.jsonRpc.allowedOperations= A12_INTERNAL_OPERATIONS, \                                                   ATTACHMENT_OPERATIONS, \                                                   CDD_OPERATIONS, \                                                   DOCUMENT_OPERATIONS, \                                                   LINK_OPERATIONS, \                                                   GET_CONTACT_REPORT  #... ``` |
```

This allows us to process the RPC request in the backend. If the operation name is not whitelisted, Data Services would block the request immediately.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The order of the operations does not have any effect. You could also add new operation names at the beginning of the list. |

#### Implementing the Contact Report Operation

To be able to process the custom RPC operation `GET_CONTACT_REPORT`, we have to extend its already provided class framework. You can refer to the previous section [ContactReportOperation](#_contactreportoperation) for more information on this framework.
The method accepts three request parameters:

* `customerType`: Specific enumeration criteria to group customers by their type, which we will use for filtering. Existing types:

  + Lead
  + Inactive
  + VIP
  + Suspended
  + Partner
* `nationality`: Specific criteria to filter contacts by their nationality. Input is plain text.
* `localeLanguage`: The language code for localizing the data. Existing locales:

  + English `en`
  + German `de`

There is just a small addition necessary to finish this class’s implementation.

Your task:

* Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a descriptive error message in the case of the `localeLanguage` neither being German nor English.
* Forward the request to `contactReportService` and return its result.

```

#### Implementing the Contact Report Service

To retrieve the list of all contacts, we have to extend the already provided class framework. You can refer to the previous section [ContactReportService](#_contactreportservice) for more information on this framework.

Before we start with the implementation, we will have a closer look at the already registered beans in this class.
In this context, only the required methods and functionalities of the used class and interfaces are highlighted.

The `QueryService` is defined as follows:

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query.QueryService.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query;  //...  public interface QueryService {     //...     <T> QueryPage<T> query(QueryRoot queryRoot, String locale); } ``` |
```

Its only publicly available method is the `query` function, which requires the following parameters:

* `QueryRoot queryRoot`: Contains the specific query parameters, such as

  + the Document Model name,
  + the name of the projection,
  + the specification of the constraints,
  + pagination settings,
  + and others.
* `String locale`: The locale for which the query is executed, which is used to interpret localized values in the query itself.

For more details, see [Data Services > QUERY JSON-RPC](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_query_json_rpc).

The `IDocumentRepository` is automatically configured by Data Services and can be easily injected into projects using the default implementation.
The primary functionalities of this interface revolve around CRUD operations, facilitating the processing of documents to and from the persistent storage. You can see how it is implemented below:

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.document.persistence.IDocumentRepository.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.document.persistence;  //...  public interface IDocumentRepository {      boolean supports(@NonNull DocumentV2 document);      boolean supports(@NonNull String modelName, @NonNull Optional<String> metadata);      Optional<DataServicesDocument> findByDocumentReference(@NonNull DocumentReference documentReference);      @NonNull List<DocumentReference> findAllDocRefsForModel(@NonNull String modelId);      @NonNull default List<DocumentReference> findAllDocRefsForModel(@NonNull String modelId, Pageable pageable) {         return findAllDocRefsForModel(modelId);     }      @NonNull List<DataServicesDocument> findDocumentsByDocRefs(@NonNull List<DocumentReference> docRefs);      void create(@NonNull DataServicesDocument dataServicesDocument);      void update(@NonNull DataServicesDocument dataServicesDocument);      void delete(@NonNull DocumentReference documentReference);      void deleteAll(@NonNull String modelName, @NonNull Collection<DocumentReference> documentReferences); } ``` |
```

A project can have multiple implementations of this interface. The `supports` method then determines for which documents which `IDocumentRepository` implementation shall be used.

For more information, refer to [Data Services > IDocumentRepository](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#iDocumentRepository).

The `DocumentModelServiceFactory` provides methods to instantiate Document Model specific services, which is implemented as follows:

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.kernel.md.facade.DocumentModelServiceFactory.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.kernel.md.facade;  //...  public class DocumentModelServiceFactory {      public IDocumentModelSerializer createDocumentModelSerializer() {         return new MDSerializerFactory().createDocumentModelSerializer();     }     public IDocumentModelService createDocumentModelService() {         return new ExternalDocumentModelService();     }     public IDocumentModelSearchService createDocumentModelSearchService(IDocumentModel documentModel) {         return new DocumentModelSearchServiceImpl(documentModel);     }     public IDocumentModelMigrator createDocumentModelMigrator(ICustomMigrationConfig customConfig) {         return new DocumentModelMigratorImpl(customConfig);     } } ``` |
```

In particular, we will use the `IDocumentModelSearchService` by utilizing the `createDocumentModelSearchService` method to create a search service for retrieving specific data from the Document Model.

The `IModelLoader` provides the method `loadModel` to retrieve a model, as you can see below:

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.model.persistence.IModelLoader.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.model.persistence;  import com.mgmtp.a12.model.Model;  import lombok.NonNull;  public interface IModelLoader<T extends Model> {     T loadModel(@NonNull String modelId); } ``` |
```

In our case, we are interested in the Document Model, which is why the function is parameterized with `IDocumentModel` in our `ContactReportService`.

Now that you have an overview of the registered beans, we can continue with the implementation of the `ContactReportService`.
At first, we will create a set of smaller helper methods. Afterward, we are going to put everything together.

##### Creating the Constraint

To use the `queryService` instance for querying contact documents, we first need to prepare the corresponding constraint of type `ILogicOperator`. This constraint will be created by combining the given parameters, such as `customerType` and `nationality`. By specifying these parameters, we ensure that the query results are limited to contacts that exact match the specific `customerType` and `nationality` values.

Such constraint can be represented in JSON as follows:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` {   "constraint": {     "operator": "and",     "operands": [       {         "operator": "exact_match",         "field": "/Contact/PersonalData/CustomerType",         "value": "lead"       },       {         "operator": "exact_match",         "field": "/Contact/PersonalData/Nationality",         "value": "German"       }     ]   } } ``` |
```

As you can see, we are combining two `exact_match` operators with an `and` operator. In the next code snippets below, you can see how this JSON structure could be mapped to the corresponding Java objects:

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query.constraint.matching.ExactMatchOperator.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query.constraint.matching;  //...  @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY) @Data @NoArgsConstructor @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true) @ToString(callSuper = true) @SuperBuilder @QueryOperator("exact_match") public class ExactMatchOperator<T> extends FieldAwareOperator implements CaseSensitive, ValueAware<T> {      private T value;     @Builder.Default private boolean caseSensitive = true; } ``` |
```

File: `com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query.constraint.logical.AndOperator.java`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` package com.mgmtp.a12.dataservices.query.constraint.logical;  //...  @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY) @Data @NoArgsConstructor @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true) @ToString(callSuper = true) @SuperBuilder @QueryOperator("and") public class AndOperator extends VariadicOperator {  } ``` |
```

Your task:

* Write a method `createExactMatchOperator` that takes `fieldPath` and `fieldValue` as inputs and returns an instance of `ExactMatchOperator`.
* Write a method `createAndOperator` that takes `customerType` and `nationality` as inputs and returns an instance of `AndOperator` which combines the 2 `ExactMatchOperator` instances created out of the inputs.

```

##### Preparing a Map for Localized Texts

A `DocumentV2` allows us to retrieve the values of enumeration fields. Each has a specific localized text, which is configured in the Document Model. We will use these texts and create a mapping for each field value and its corresponding localized text.

We can then use this mapping whenever a correct translation for a given field is necessary. Especially when the mapping between the `DocumentV2` and our `Contact` data object will be done.

Therefore, add the following to the `ContactReportService.java`:

```

When having a closer look at the `searchService`, we can observe the following structure for the enumeration fields:

![document model enumerations localized values](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/document_model_enumerations_localized_values.png)

As you can see, the localized labels for English and German are defined inside the enumeration field type of our Document Model.

##### Getting String Field Values

In the previous step, we prepared the retrieval of texts from enumeration fields and their respective localized labels.
For the string based values however, we can just access the `DocumentV2` directly.

For this, we will use the approach with the generated typed classes which was described in [Tutorials > Backend > Document Manipulation > Modification of a Document > Specific Approach](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_document_manipulation/index.html#_specific_approach). While retrieving field values in this way, we have to consider that `null` can be returned, but in that case, we want to use the empty string.

Therefore, add the following to the `ContactReportService.java`:

File: `server/app/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/tutorial/server/report/ContactReportService.java`

```

```

##### Mapping Contact Document to Contact Object

Before we start with the mapping between documents and contact objects, we are going to implement the last helper method.
We are going to add another method, which will take care of mapping the **Phones** group of a document.
This group contains the nested fields **PhoneNumber** and **Type**, so we need to map these phone fields from the document to our Java `Contact` object.

Your task:

* With the generated typed classes, get the phones defined in the document and iterate over them.
* Extract the **PhoneNumber** and **Type** values from the document.
* Use the `phoneTypeToLocalizedTextMap` to get the localized text for the phone type.
* Create a `Contact.Phone` object for each phone number and type combination.
* Use the following method framework for your implementation:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ```     /**      * Maps the phone numbers and types from an {@link Contact_DM} to a list of {@link Contact.Phone} objects.      *      * @param contactDoc the contact document containing phone information.      * @param phoneTypeToLocalizedTextMap the mapping of phone types to their localized text.      * @return a list of {@link Contact.Phone} objects populated with phone numbers and types from the document.      */     private List<Contact.Phone> mapToContactPhones(             Contact_DM contactDoc,             Map<String, String> phoneTypeToLocalizedTextMap     ) {         return contactDoc.contact().phones().stream()             // Put your code here ...             .toList();     } ``` |
```

```

All required helper methods are now written, which allows us to implement the method responsible for mapping the entire contact documents and `Contact` Java objects.

Your task:

* Implement the `mapToContact` method, which retrieves the following values from the document and creates a `Contact` object:

  + `firstName`
  + `lastName`
  + `email`
  + `gender`
  + `nationality`
  + `customerType`
  + `phones`
* Use the following method framework for your implementation:

```

```

##### Putting Everything Together

Now that everything is prepared, we can proceed with implementing the entry function `getContacts` of our `ContactReportService` class.
This means we can finally put together all the helper methods we created previously and finish this task.

Your task:

* Create a `QueryRoot` object with the corresponding builder. Since we are searching for documents, the projection name should be `document`. Add a paging of `new Paging(0, 10)` to limit the result to 10 items.
* Use the `queryService` and the just created `QueryRoot` instance to query for the contact documents, which will yield a `RootQueryPage<DocumentTreeResult>`. Since we are expecting a not localized value for `customerType`, we can pass `null` as the locale.
* Use the `documentRepository` to retrieve all `DataServicesDocument` instances for the document references.
* Use the `documentModelLoader` to retrieve the Document Model.
* Create an instance of `IDocumentModelSearchService`.
* Use the previously implemented helper methods to map all documents to `Contact` Java objects.

```

All classes required for the reporting functionality have now been implemented. In the next step, we can start the application and send a request to our new `GET_CONTACT_REPORT` RPC endpoint.

### Running the Application

Now that everything is set up, we can start our application and test the changes in action.
To test our new endpoint, first run the application. Then, add a few contact documents with nationality and customer type set.

You can find instructions on how to build and start the application in [Tutorials > General Information > Setup](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html#_setup).
Since we only modified the `server/app` module, you do not have to build the entire application; you can simply execute the following command:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:build ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You might run into **Checkstyle** compile errors. If that is the case, you can either run the build with `gradle build -P skipCheckstyle=true`, set the **skipCheckstyle** property in `gradle.properties` to `true`, or fix the Checkstyle errors. |

If you would like to load some initial data, you can also run the init app before starting the server:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:init:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env,init-data' ``` |
```

### Access Token

Before using the custom operation `GET_CONTACT_REPORT`, we need to retrieve the access token, which needs to be set in the header of the RPC request.

#### Explanation

An access token is a security credential used in the authentication and authorization processes in web and mobile applications. It verifies a user’s identity and permissions, allowing access to protected resources.

#### Background

* **Issuance**: Access tokens are generated by an authorization server after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes to an application.
* **Format**: They can be in different formats such as opaque strings or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are commonly used because they are self-contained and can carry claims or user information.
* **Scope**: Access tokens include scopes, which define what resources or actions the token holder can access.
* **Expiration**: Access tokens have a limited lifespan and expire after a certain period of time, enhancing security by reducing the risk if a token is compromised.
* **Validation**: Servers validate access tokens before allowing access to protected resources. For JWTs, this involves checking the signature and ensuring the token has not expired.

The Access Token is generated after a successful authentication process, called login flow. The client initiating the login flow stores the token and sends it with each request as an authorization header.

Our backend is using an A12 library called User Authorization Authentication (UAA) for authentication and authorization. We are using local authentication in the tutorial application, which means:

* UAA acts as Identity Provider (IDP), providing the login endpoint.
* The implementor is responsible for credential validation.
* UAA generates the access token.

So, the authorization header format for the request sent to our app would be: **Authorization**: `UAABearer <Token>`

#### Receiving an Access Token

The token can be easily retrieved via either of the following methods:

* Using the Browser’s **Network** tab:
  Go to the **Network** tab in your browser’s developer tools. Click on one of the **rpc** request. If none are available, refresh the tutorial application. Go to the request **Headers** and copy the **Authorization** value.
  ![access token network](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/access_token_network.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) may truncate the value in the Network tab (indicated by "…"). To avoid this, make sure you copy the unformatted value. |

* Using the Redux DevTools:
  Go to the **Redux** tab in your browser’s developer tools (if not available, you will have to install the corresponding extension). Open one of the **UAA**-actions (e.g. `UAA/UPDATE_ACCESS_TOKEN`) and open the **uaa** slice. Copy the **access\_token** value. When sending the request with the token, it is necessary to prefix it with `UAABearer <Token>`.
  ![access token redux](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/access_token_redux.png)

To verify that the token you copied is valid, you can use [jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io/).
Paste your token there—you should be able to view its decoded header and payload if it is valid.

### Sending a Request

As you might have already noticed, we did not add a button or functionality in the frontend to send a request to our new endpoint.

To test it, we will instead use a tool called "Bruno", which allows us to easily create and send multiple HTTP requests to an endpoint.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You could also use other tools or send a request directly from the command line. However, Bruno is a convenient choice, especially since it’s a generally useful tool for development. |

#### Getting Bruno

Bruno offers for most platforms so-called "Portable" versions, which do not require any installation. We recommend using these versions if possible.

Download: [Bruno Tool](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads)

When the download was successful, start the application.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The screenshots below were taken using Bruno version 1.13.1. Please install the latest version and just keep in mind that the user interface may look slightly different. |

#### Configuring Bruno

To be able to send requests via Bruno, we have to do a few configurations.

1. **Create a new collection**:
   Click on the more options menu (⋯) and create a new collection with the name "Tutorial".
   ![bruno create collection](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_create_collection.png)
2. **Create a new request**:
   Click on the more options menu (⋯) next to the previously created collection and add a new **POST** request with the name "GET\_CONTACT\_REPORT" and the URL "http://localhost:8081/api/v2/rpc".
   ![bruno create request 1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_create_request_1.png)
   ![bruno create request 2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_create_request_2.png)
3. **Adding an authorization header**:
   Click on the **Headers** tab, add a new header called "Authorization" and set its value to the access token.
   ![bruno add authorization](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_add_authorization.png)
4. **Adding a request body**:
   Click on the **Body** tab, select **JSON** from the dropdown on the right and add a request body, for example:

   ```
   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` {     "jsonrpc": "2.0",     "id": "Get Contact Report 1",     "method": "GET_CONTACT_REPORT",     "params": {       "customerType": "lead",       "nationality": "British",       "localeLanguage": "de"     } } ``` |
   ```

   ![bruno add request body](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_add_request_body.png)
5. **Sending the request**:
   Click on the arrow icon (→, on the top right corner of the tool) or press `CTRL` + `ENTER`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a result similar to the following:
   ![bruno send request](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_custom_endpoint/assets/bruno_send_request.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you receive an "…​Invalid character in header content \["Authorization"]" error when sending the request, make sure to copy the whole access token. For example, the **formatted** access token from Firefox’s **Network** tab contains the …-character which means that the value has been shortened. |

|  | If you receive a "401 Unauthorized" error when sending the request, you most likely have to copy the access token again. Access tokens are refreshed regularly, and an old token may have been invalidated. |

You have now implemented your first custom endpoint and successfully sent a request to it.
Take a moment to explore the response and experiment a bit. Try modifying the request, adjusting the endpoint’s behavior, or adding additional parameters to see how the endpoint reacts. This is a great way to deepen your understanding of how everything works together.

## Conclusion

In this task, you learned how to

* register your own RPC operation,
* use Data Services API for querying documents and loading Document Models,
* map field values of `DocumentV2` instances to Java objects,
* retrieve an access token and send an HTTP request via Bruno.
