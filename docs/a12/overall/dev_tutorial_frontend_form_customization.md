# Task 3 - Form Customization

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This tutorial uses A12 version 2025.06-ext5 and is based on the Project Template version 202506.5.1. |

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you are new to the development tutorials, make sure to first go through [Tutorials > General Information](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_general_information/index.html) and [Tutorials > Frontend > Introduction](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_intro/index.html) before continuing here. |

You can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/frontend/task-3-start** to follow along this tutorial.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out the tag **2025.06-ext5/frontend/task-3-end** to see how your code differs from the solution.

## Use-Case

In [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html), we enhanced our CRM application’s overview by adding a button to highlight upcoming contact birthdays. This feature helps our customers remember when a contact’s birthday is today or within the week.

Given the importance of birthday reminders to our customers, we will now extend this functionality to the contact form.

In the contact form, we will not just highlight an approaching birthday - we will also display how many days away it is. This ensures that our customers are well-prepared. To achieve this, we will add an icon next to the date of birth field and a message box at the top of the contact form to display this information.

## End Result

By the end of this task, you will have learned:

* How to navigate and utilize the public API of the Form Engine.
* How to extend and customize the form component provided by A12.
* How to model, access and use annotations within a custom implementation.

Assuming today is July 1st, the final outcome of this task will look as follows:

![final feature](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/final_feature.png)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Before we begin, let us outline the features we want to add to the contact form using the following acceptance criteria:

1. Display an icon next to the date of birth field if the contact’s birthday is approaching.

   * Use one icon if the birthday is today and a different one if it falls within the week.
2. Add a message box at the top of the form to inform the user how many days remain until the birthday.

Customizing an A12 form to achieve this follows a similar process to the overview customization in [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html).
We will start by creating a new view component for the custom form and integrate it into the Application Model.
Then, we will customize this view component using the available interfaces and properties to meet the specified requirements.

### Creating a Custom Form Component

Let us begin by setting up a view component for the contact form, which we will later customize.
The current view component for the form is defined in the `client/src/app/EnginesViewMap.tsx` file, similar to the `OverviewEngine` component, as shown below:

File: `client/src/app/EnginesViewMap.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` //... import type { View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { CRUDViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.crud/crud-core"; //...  type ViewMap = Record<string, View.ViewComponent | undefined>;  export const enginesViewMap = {     //...     FormEngine(props) {         return <CRUDViews.FormEngineView {...props} />;     },     //... } satisfies ViewMap; ``` |
```

We will now create our own view component to replace the current one. However, we cannot use `CRUDViews.FormEngineView` as the basis for our form customization, as it does not support passing essential properties such as `formModelMap` and `widgetMap`. These properties are necessary for our customization, but `CRUDViews` are not intended for such modifications.

In [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization > Creating a Custom Overview Component](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html#_creating_a_custom_overview_component), we were able to use `CRUDViews.OverviewEngineView` because it provided the necessary properties for overview customization. However, this was an exception made to simplify the tutorial and is not recommended for standard projects.

Since this approach is not feasible for the form, we will instead use the `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` component for our custom view component. This component allows us to pass in a custom `formModelMap` and `widgetMap`, providing the flexibility needed for our customization.
For more detailed information about this component and other options for integrating the Form Engine into the Client of your application, you can refer to [Form Engine > Client Integration](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#form-engine_integration_client_setup).

With the information above, you are now ready to create the custom view component and use it in the Application Model.

Your task:

1. Create the component `CustomContactForm` that will be displayed in the view component:

   * Add a new folder called "CustomContactForm" in `client/src/modules/contact/components` with a new file named `index.tsx`.
   * In this file, create a basic React component with `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` as the return value.
2. Extend the custom view provider of the contact module to include this `CustomContactForm` component.
3. Use this `CustomContactForm` for the "ContactForm" scene of the contact module in the `Tutorial_AM` Application Model.

Step 1:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement } from "react";  import type { View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { FormEngineViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  export default function CustomContactForm(props: View): ReactElement {     return <FormEngineViews.FormEngine {...props} />; } ``` |
```

Step 2:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/index.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` //... import CustomContactForm from "./components/CustomContactForm";  const VIEWS: { [name: string]: View.ViewComponent | undefined } = {     HighlightedDateOverview,     CustomContactForm }; //... ``` |
```

Step 3:

Change the `VIEW_ADD` directive in the "ContactForm" scene of the contact module in `Tutorial_AM` as follows:

![custom form app model](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/custom_form_app_model.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | After making any changes to the models, remember to save them before restarting the server or deploy them in the SME. |

To ensure that our application is still functioning correctly, open any contact form. It should display the standard form, since no customizations have been added yet.

The properties of the `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` component consist of the standard `View` props (such as the activity id) and additional Form Engine `Config` props.
These `Config` props include options like `cardView`, `timeMode`, and `enablements`. You can find the complete list of available props for `Config` in [Form Engine > API Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_api_documentation).

For a first customization, we can once again use `cardView`. This property determines whether the card view should be used for repeats.

Your task:

Use the `SizeContext` in our `CustomFormComponent` to toggle the `cardView` for repeats based on the current screen size.

Click to see solution

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement, useContext } from "react"; //... import { SizeContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core";  export default function CustomContactForm(props: View): ReactElement {     const { currentSize } = useContext(SizeContext);     const isSmallScreenSize = currentSize === "xs" || currentSize === "sm";      return <FormEngineViews.FormEngine {...props} cardView={isSmallScreenSize} />; } ``` |
```

You can now open one of the forms and observe how the repeats respond to screen size changes.
On smaller screens, inline repeats - such as phone numbers - should be displayed in `cardView`, as shown below:

With this, we have done a first customization of the form in the contact module. We now have a good basis for implementing the actual feature.

### Customizing a Control

We will begin by implementing the first part of our feature: Displaying icons next to the "DateOfBirth" field in the form. To achieve this, we need to identify and access the specific field next to which the icon should be displayed.
In the overview, we used the column id for this purpose. However, in the form, we can take advantage of a more convenient feature: annotations.

#### Annotation

Annotations can be added to the Form Model to identify specific elements. The resulting application can then access and use those annotations, e.g. to display all fields with a specific annotation in bold.
To add an annotation to the "DateOfBirth" field in the `Contact_FM` Form Model, we need to do the following:

* Select the "DateOfBirth" control in the `Contact_FM` to open its editor.
* Go to the section **Annotations** and add the following entry:

  + **Name**: `contact-dob-field`
  + **Value**: `true`
* Click **Apply**.

  ![add annotation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/add_annotation.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The field and value of the annotation can be chosen freely depending on the specific use case. It is only important to reference them correctly in the code. |

Now that we have annotated our field, we need to access this annotation within our custom form.
This can be done via the `FormModelMap` property in `FormEngineViews.FormEngine`.
You will see how this works in the following section.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | After making any changes to the models, remember to save them before restarting the server or deploy them in the SME. |

#### Rendering the Form

To understand how we can add Widgets to our form, we first need to understand how the form is rendered based on the Form Model.

The `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` component itself consists of the `ScrollHandler`, `ContentBox` and the `FormEngineRenderer`. Out of these components, the `FormEngineRenderer` handles the rendering of the Form Model.
It gets the state, event handlers and the configuration options from the `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` component as props.
To customize the rendering of the form, these props can be modified.
You can find more details on how Form Model elements are rendered in
[Form Engine > Rendering](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#form-engine_rendering).

The configuration options specifically are what we will use for our customization. They are of type `Config`, which we have already seen when dealing with the `cardView`.
Two other properties of this interface are `formModelMap` and `widgetMap`, which can be used to modify the appearance of the form.

The `formModelMap` maps each Form Model element to a React component.
It defines which components should be rendered for which element.
There are three different kinds of Form Model elements:

* Containers:

  + Section
  + Screen
  + Control Grid
* Repeats:

  + Detached Repeats
  + Inline Repeats
  + Embedded Repeats
* Controls:

  + Input elements for modifying the field data of the document.
  + A complete overview is available in [Form Engine > Controls](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_controls).

The `widgetMap`, on the other hand, maps each Widget, e.g. Button, to a React component. Parts of this map can then be replaced with custom Widgets.

For more details on the `formModelMap` and the `widgetMap`, you can refer to [Form Engine > API Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_api_documentation).

Based on this, both the `formModelMap` and the `widgetMap` are necessary for our use case.
We will need the `formModelMap` to access the "DateOfBirth" control, next to which we want to display our custom icon Widget, and the `widgetMap` to handle the actual rendering of that Widget.

##### FormModelMap

As a first step, we will need to access the `formModelMap` to identify the "DateOfBirth" control based on its annotation.

Inside the `formModelMap`, we find the `Control` property, which contains all relevant information about controls, including "DateOfBirth".
You can find more details on this property in [Form Engine > API Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/form_engine/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_api_documentation)..

To investigate this further for our application, we can use the `formModelMap` to log the props of this `Control` to the console as follows:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` //... import { DefaultFormModelMap, FormModelMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  export default function CustomContactForm(props: View): ReactElement {     //...     return <FormEngineViews.FormEngine {...props} formModelMap={ContactFormFormModelMap} cardView={isSmallScreenSize} />; }  export const ContactFormFormModelMap: FormModelMap = {     ...DefaultFormModelMap,     Control: {         component(controlProps) {             console.log(controlProps);             return <DefaultFormModelMap.Control.component {...controlProps} />;         }     } }; ``` |
```

We see a list of multiple control properties, which makes sense since our form contains multiple inputs. We will focus on the fourth entry, as "DateOfBirth" is the fourth input in the form. This entry includes the key and value of the annotation we just set in the SME:

![console annotation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/console_annotation.png)

Therefore, we now know how we can access the annotation for our custom view component for the form.

##### WidgetMap

However, we cannot access the annotations within the props of the elements of the `widgetMap`, which is where we actually need them.
This presents a challenge because we need to modify the Widget in the `widgetMap` that is used to render the "DateOfBirth" input element.

We can solve this by creating a context for the `Control` element in the `formModelMap` and then consuming that context in the element that we want to modify within the `widgetMap`.

To do this, we need to first create a new component that extends the `Control` element of the default `formModelMap`.
Create a new file `ContactFormControl.tsx` in the folder `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm` and add the following code:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormControl.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement } from "react";  import type { FormModel } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; import { DefaultFormModelMap, FormModelMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  export default function ContactFormControl(     props: FormModelMap.FormModelComponentProps<FormModel.Control> ): ReactElement {     return <DefaultFormModelMap.Control.component {...props} />; } ``` |
```

We can now use this `ContactFormControl` component for the `Control` property in the `formModelMap`:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` //... import ContactFormControl from "./ContactFormControl";  export const ContactFormFormModelMap: FormModelMap = {     ...DefaultFormModelMap,     Control: {         component(controlProps) {             return <ContactFormControl {...controlProps} />;         }     } }; //... ``` |
```

Next, we can create a react context and wrap the `Control` component with it, as shown below:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormControl.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement, createContext } from "react"; //...  export const ContactFormControlContext = createContext<     { modelElement: FormModel.Control } | undefined >(undefined);  export default function ContactFormControl(     props: FormModelMap.FormModelComponentProps<FormModel.Control> ): ReactElement {     return (         <ContactFormControlContext.Provider value={{modelElement: props.modelElement}}>             <DefaultFormModelMap.Control.component {...props} />         </ContactFormControlContext.Provider>     ); } ``` |
```

By using this context, we will be able to access the `modelElement` property of the control, that includes the annotations, whenever we want to consume it deeper the tree.

#### Custom Input

We will need the annotations later when customizing the input to ensure that only the "DateOfBirth" control is modified.
But first, we need to create the component for our custom input.

The Form Engine, by default, uses the `TextLineStateless` Widget to display the input for a simple text in the form.
Therefore, we will need to create a custom component for the custom input that extends and customizes this Widget.
To do this, create a new file called `ContactFormTextLineStateless.tsx` in the
`client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm` folder add the following code:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormTextLineStateless.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement } from "react";  import { DefaultWidgetMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; import type { TextLineStatelessProps } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core";  export default function ContactFormTextLineStateless(props: TextLineStatelessProps): ReactElement {     return <DefaultWidgetMap.TextLineStateless {...props} />; } ``` |
```

We now want to customize the input for "DateOfBirth".
To do this, we will need to access the annotations to identify the corresponding control.
We can get the array with the annotations from the `modelElement` property by using the previously created context.

To achieve this, we need to extend the `ContactFormTextLineStateless` component by integrating the `ContactFormControlContext` context. Once we make sure that this context exists, we can access the annotations and check if our defined date of birth annotation name exists for the current control.
If this is the case, we will display a customized component that we will create later on. Otherwise, we will use the default `TextLineStateless` component.
You can see how this can be implemented in the following code snippet:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormTextLineStateless.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement, useContext } from "react"; //... import type { FormModel } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  import { ContactFormControlContext } from "./ContactFormControl";  // Define the annotation name that was set in the form model const AnnotationBirthdayAddon = "contact-dob-field";  export default function ContactFormTextLineStateless(props: TextLineStatelessProps): ReactElement {      // Get the model element of the current control from custom context     const modelElement = useContext(ContactFormControlContext)?.modelElement;       // Check if Model Element is of type Control and has a birthday annotation     if (         modelElement &&         FormModel.Control.isInstance(modelElement) &&         modelElement.annotations?.some((annot) => annot.name === AnnotationBirthdayAddon)     ) {         // Return a customized component.     }      return <DefaultWidgetMap.TextLineStateless {...props} />; } ``` |
```

To render this component, we need to customize the `TextLineStateless` property in the `widgetMap`. Since this process is very similar to how we previously customized the `formModelMap`, you can try implementing it yourself.

Your task:

* Define a `widgetMap` in `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`.
* Customize its `TextLineStateless` prop by providing the `ContactFormTextLineStateless` component instead.
* Pass the customized `widgetMap` as a prop to the `FormEngineViews.FormEngine` component.

Click to see solution

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 ``` | ``` //... import {     DefaultFormModelMap,     DefaultWidgetMap,     FormModelMap,     WidgetMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  //... import ContactFormTextLineStateless from "./ContactFormTextLineStateless";  export default function CustomContactForm(props: View): ReactElement {     //...     return (         <FormEngineViews.FormEngine             {...props}             formModelMap={ContactFormFormModelMap}             widgetMap={ContactFormWidgetMap}             cardView={isSmallScreenSize}         />     ); }  export const ContactFormFormModelMap: FormModelMap = {     //... };  export const ContactFormWidgetMap: WidgetMap = {     ...DefaultWidgetMap,     TextLineStateless(textLineStatelessProps) {         return <ContactFormTextLineStateless {...textLineStatelessProps} />;     } }; ``` |
```

Now, the only missing part is the custom component that we want to return in `ContactFormTextLineStateless` for the "DateOfBirth" input when the annotation criteria is fulfilled.

We will create a new file named `BirthdayTextLineStateless.tsx` in the `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm` folder for this component.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/BirthdayTextLineStateless.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement } from "react";  import { DefaultWidgetMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; import type { TextLineStatelessProps } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core";  export default function BirthdayTextLineStateless(props: TextLineStatelessProps): ReactElement {      return <DefaultWidgetMap.TextLineStateless {...props} />; } ``` |
```

In `BirthdayTextLineStateless`, we will then display an [Icon Widget](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/38.3.3/#/widgets/general/icon) after the input. This is done by using the `addonAfter` property of the `TextLineStateless` component.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` //... import { Icon } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core"; //...  export default function BirthdayTextLineStateless(props: TextLineStatelessProps): ReactElement {     return <DefaultWidgetMap.TextLineStateless {...props} addonAfter={<Icon>celebration</Icon>} />; } ``` |
```

Now, we can use this component in `ContactFormTextLineStateless` for the "DateOfBirth" input.

However, according to our acceptance criteria, the icon should only be displayed if the contact’s birthday falls within the week. Additionally, different icons should be used to indicate whether the birthday is today or later in the week.
To achieve this, we need to determine the relevant date information and pass the appropriate icon to component.

In [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html), we performed similar checks for highlighting values in the overview.
To improve modularity and maintain a clear separation of concerns, we will extract this logic from the `TableBodyCell` component into a utility function.
This utility function has already been provided in the starting tag **2025.06-ext5/frontend/task-3-start**, along with the necessary refactoring. You can find all the date-checking functionalities in the `client/src/modules/contact/utils/dateUtils.ts` file.

Now, we can use the utility functions `isBirthdayTodayOrNextWeek` and `getDateFromString` to determine whether the entered date of birth is today or within the week.
We will also use the `LocalizerContext` to ensure the date is correctly parsed from the string format.

To obtain a correctly formatted date of birth, we first encapsulate the parsing helpers in a custom react hook.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` import { /*...*/ useContext } from "react";  //... import { LocalizerContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization-react";  import { getDateFromString /*...*/ } from "../../utils/dateUtils";  //... function useBirthdayDate(birthday: string | undefined): Date | undefined {     const language = useContext(LocalizerContext).locale.language;     return birthday ? getDateFromString(birthday, language) : undefined; } ``` |
```

Based on a correct birthday `Date` object and the `isBirthdayTodayOrNextWeek` util function, we can now decide how and which icon to display. For better reusability we move the addon icon creation into a custom react component.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` //... import { Icon } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core"; //...  import { /*...*/ isBirthdayTodayOrNextWeek } from "../../utils/dateUtils";  //... function BirthdayAddon({ birthday }: { birthday?: Date }) {     if (birthday) {         const { isBirthdayToday, isBirthdayNextWeek } = isBirthdayTodayOrNextWeek(birthday);          if (isBirthdayToday || isBirthdayNextWeek) {             return (                 <Icon size="big" className={`-u-text-${isBirthdayToday ? "green" : "yellow"}`}>                     {isBirthdayToday ? "celebration" : "notification_important"}                 </Icon>             );         }     }     return null; } //... ``` |
```

Unlike in [Tutorials > Frontend > Overview Customization > Getting the Overview Column Value](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_overview_customization/index.html#_getting_the_overview_column_value), retrieving the contact’s date of birth is much simpler here since input values are stored as data within the activity and can be easily accessed through the `TextLineStatelessProps` properties.

Put together our `BirthdayTextLineStateless` now should look like that:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` //... export default function BirthdayTextLineStateless(props: TextLineStatelessProps): ReactElement {     const birthday = useBirthdayDate(props.value);      return <DefaultWidgetMap.TextLineStateless {...props} addonAfter={<BirthdayAddon birthday={birthday} />} />; } //... ``` |
```

Integrate the `BirthdayTextLineStateless` into `ContactFormTextLineStateless` as our customized component.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormTextLineStateless.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` //...     if (         modelElement &&         FormModel.Control.isInstance(modelElement) &&         modelElement.annotations?.some((annot) => annot.name === AnnotationBirthdayAddon)     ) {         return <BirthdayTextLineStateless {...props} />;     } //... ``` |
```

If you open the form of a contact whose birthday is soon, an icon should appear next to the "DateOfBirth" field, as illustrated below.

* If the birthday of the contact is today:

  ![icon form today](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/icon_form_today.png)
* If the birthday of the contact is within the week:

  ![icon form this week](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/icon_form_this_week.png)

This completes the first part of our feature request and demonstrates how to customize a control within the form.

### Customizing a Container

Next, we will focus on implementing the second part of our requirement: displaying a message box at the top of each form to inform the user of how many days remain until the contact’s next birthday.

Unlike the previous customization, this information does not need to be associated with a specific Form Model element. Instead, we will add it to a container - specifically, the outer screen of the `Contact_FM` Form Model.

To achieve this, we will create a custom component to extend the `Screen` component and use it to customize the `formModelMap`.
Since many of the steps and principles are similar to those in the previous section, you can try implementing this on your own.

Your task:

1. Create a custom React component called `ContactFormScreen` in the `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm` folder.

   * Use the default screen as the basis by returning `DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component`.
2. Use this component to customize the `formModelMap` in the `CustomContactForm` component.
3. Add a [Global Message Box Widget](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/38.3.3/#/widgets/feedback/global-message-box) above the `DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component` with a placeholder text to the component.

Step 1:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormScreen.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` import { ReactElement } from "react";  import type { FormModel } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; import { DefaultFormModelMap, FormModelMap } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core";  export default function ContactFormScreen(     props: FormModelMap.FormModelComponentProps<FormModel.Screen> ): ReactElement {     return <DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component {...props} />; } ``` |
```

Step 2:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/index.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` //... import ContactFormScreen from "./ContactFormScreen";  export const ContactFormFormModelMap: FormModelMap = {     //...     Screen: {         component(screenProps) {             return <ContactFormScreen {...screenProps} />;         }     } } ``` |
```

Step 3:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormScreen.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` //... import { GlobalMessageBox } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core";  export default function ContactFormScreen(     props: FormModelMap.FormModelComponentProps<FormModel.Screen> ): ReactElement {     return (         <>             <GlobalMessageBox content="A very meaningful message" />             <DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component {...props} />         </>     ); } ``` |
```

Now, when you open the form, you should see the following information displayed:

![placeholder info box](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/placeholder_info_box.png)

As a next step, we will replace the placeholder text with an actual meaningful and dynamic message. To do this, we first will need to set the proper localization resources.

As we need to display dynamic data within the localized text, we will use a template string like `$var$`.
We can then pass the data for that template string to the localizer, for example, like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` localizer(RESOURCE_KEYS.your.custom.key, { var: { type: "plain", value: "x" } }) ``` |
```

You can now use this approach for the localization resources for the messages that should be displayed.

Your task:

* Extend the `RESOURCE_KEYS` to include keys for localizing the two messages that should be displayed, depending on whether the birthday is today or in the coming days.
* Provide the corresponding resources for the English and German locale. If the birthday is not today, include the number of days remaining by using a template string.
* Use these localization resources for the content of the `GlobalMessageBox` in the `ContactFormScreen` component.

```

```

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormScreen.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` //... import { RESOURCE_KEYS, useLocalizer } from "../../../../localization";  export default function ContactFormScreen(     props: FormModelMap.FormModelComponentProps<FormModel.Screen> ): ReactElement {     const localizer = useLocalizer();      return (         <>             <GlobalMessageBox                 content={localizer(RESOURCE_KEYS.contact.form.screen.daysUntilBirthday, { daysNum: { type: "plain", value: "5" } })}             />             <DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component {...props} />         </>     ); } ``` |
```

If you now open a form in the application, you will see that our localized resources are being used:

![dynamic info box](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/dynamic_info_box.png)

The downside is that we are currently using a static number in our template string, which is not accurate.
Instead, we need to retrieve the actual date of birth for the contact. Similar to the previous section, this information can be found in the activity associated with the current form.

To achieve this, we can use the `FormEngineSelectors.dataState` method to create a selector that accesses the data slice of the form for the default data holder of a given activity. Some of these terms, such as "data holder," may be unfamiliar at this point, but they will be explained in detail in [Tutorials > Frontend > Data in Activities](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_data_in_activities/index.html).

The `FormEngineSelectors.dataState` method only requires the `activityId` of the currently opened form, which is available as react context `ViewViews.ActivityContext` and can be received inside any client view as follows:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` import { useContext } from "react"; import { ViewViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  // activity context and also activityId can be undefined. // it is recommended to implement a fallback here const activityId = useContext(ViewViews.ActivityContext)?.activityId ?? "No view context with activityId provided"; ``` |
```

To have our `ContactFormScreen` stay clean we move all the message related code parts inside an own custom component named `BirthdayReminderBox`.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/BirthdayReminderBox.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` import { GlobalMessageBox } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core";  import { RESOURCE_KEYS, useLocalizer } from "../../../../localization";  export function BirthdayReminderBox() {     const localizer = useLocalizer();      return (         <GlobalMessageBox             content={localizer(RESOURCE_KEYS.contact.form.screen.daysUntilBirthday, { daysNum: { type: "plain", value: "5" } })}         />     ); } ``` |
```

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/ContactFormScreen.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` //...  import { BirthdayReminderBox } from "./BirthdayReminderBox";  //...     return (         <>             <BirthdayReminderBox />             <DefaultFormModelMap.Screen.component {...props} />         </>     ); //... ``` |
```

Now, we can use the previously mentioned `FormEngineSelectors.dataState` method to obtain the required selector.
With this selector, we can retrieve the `dataState` for the currently open form.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/BirthdayReminderBox.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` import { useContext } from "react"; import { useSelector } from "react-redux";  //... import { FormEngineSelectors } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; import { ViewViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; //..  export function BirthdayReminderBox() {     const activityId = useContext(ViewViews.ActivityContext)?.activityId ?? "No view context with activityId provided";     const dataState = useSelector(FormEngineSelectors.dataState(activityId));     //... } ``` |
```

However, we still need to extract the value for the "DateOfBirth" field from it.
To access the data for a specific field from the `dataState`, you will need to typecast it to a type that reflects the path to the desired field in the Document Model. The necessary type for this is already provided in `client/src/modules/contact/types/contact.ts` and is structured as follows:

File: `client/src/modules/contact/types/contact.ts`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` export type Contact = {     PersonalData: {         DateOfBirth?: Date | null;     }; }; ``` |
```

As you can see, the `Contact` type currently only includes one field.
This is because it is not necessary to replicate the entire Document Model structure, only the fields that need to be accessed.
Please note that since "DateOfBirth" is not a required field, it might be set to `null`.

It is essential to ensure that the `Contact` type remains aligned with the Document Model. Consequently, any modifications to the structure of `Contact_DM` should be updated in the `Contact` type accordingly.

With this, we have all the necessary parts to get the current value for the "DateOfBirth" field.
To optimize resolving of the "DateOfBirth" we should move its selection into a custom redux selector.
In react-redux the return value of a `useSelector` call will trigger a rerender every time it is changed.
Since the `BirthdayReminderBox` is only necessary to rerender when date of birth changes but not when any other document data changes, this will help to avoid multiple rerender.

File: `client/src/modules/contact/components/CustomContactForm/BirthdayReminderBox.tsx`

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` //... import { DefaultRootState /*...*/ } from "react-redux";  //... import { FormEngineSelectors } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.formengine/formengine-core"; //...  import { Contact } from "../../types/contact"; //...  export function BirthdayReminderBox() {     //... }  function dateOfBirthSelector(activityId: string) {     return (state: DefaultRootState) => {         // Get the data state from current activity         const dataState = FormEngineSelectors.dataState(activityId)(state);         // The state holds contact data in the shape of our Contact_DM         const contact = (dataState.document as { Contact?: Contact }).Contact;          return contact?.PersonalData.DateOfBirth;     }; } ``` |
```

You can now try completing the `BirthdayReminderBox` component yourself.

Your task:

* Calculate the number of days remaining until the birthday using the "DateOfBirth" value and the `daysUntil` method from `client/src/modules/contact/utils/dateUtils.ts`.
* Display the dynamic message in the `GlobalMessageBox`, indicating the actual number of days left until the birthday.
* Conditionally render the `GlobalMessageBox` only if the "DateOfBirth" value is provided. This prevents the message box from appearing when the birthday input is not filled.

```

When you now open a form in the application, you will see a message box at the top displaying how many days remain until the contact’s birthday:

![final info box](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_form_customization/assets/final_info_box.png)

With this, we have completed the form customization and successfully fulfilled the second part of the feature request.
