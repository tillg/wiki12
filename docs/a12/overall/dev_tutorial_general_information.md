# General Information

## Introduction

With A12, large parts of an application can be created and maintained by business analysts via modeling. Depending on the specific use cases however often further customizations are required, for which a developer is needed. These tutorials are intended as a starting point for development with A12.

In these tutorials you will learn how to navigate an A12 project, gain a better understanding of how A12 works and how to interact with the API of different A12 components, to enable you to transfer this knowledge then to the specific use cases in your project.

### Use-Case

These aspects will be shown based on the use case of a small customer relationship management (CRM) system, to track customer contacts. Of course, the goal is not to have a production ready application, but to give you an introduction into some core concepts of an A12 application.

### Update Policy

The tutorials are available for every supported release line of A12. The specific A12 and Project Template version is documented at the start of each tutorial.
You can switch to a different version using the version selector in the top left corner of the documentation page. Note that tutorials are not necessarily available for every ext version listed in the dropdown.

These minor ext releases of A12 represent different states of the same release line and are therefore compatible with each other.
Since usually the changes within them do not affect the tutorials, they are generally not updated for every ext release. Whether a tutorial is updated for such a minor or patch release is decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Feedback

Please keep in mind that the development tutorials are a work in progress and are being continuously updated and extended with new tasks and additional tutorials. If your topic of interest is not part of a tutorial yet, it might be included in the future.

If you have wishes for future content, find something that does not work as described, or you get stuck, do not hesitate to let us know as the tutorials get better with your feedback.
For details on reaching our team, please visit our [support page on GetA12](https://geta12.com/#/support/support-overview) or use the feedback button at the top of the documentation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The tutorials do not require any previous knowledge of A12. If you are completely new to A12, we recommend you to take a look at [Overall > What Is A12](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/what_is_a12/index.html) to get an understanding about basic concepts and the way it works.

The target audience for these tutorials are developers. Therefore, some prior basic knowledge in certain technologies is assumed. The specific technologies differ a bit depending on the tutorial and its focus on frontend and/or backend. You can find a specific list in the "Prerequisites" section of each tutorial.

Generally, the tutorials also assume you have the following programs available:

* Text editor / IDE
* [A12 Modeling Environment](https://geta12.com/installer/) in version **2025.06-ext5**

### Download

The code for the tutorial application is available on GitHub, where you can clone the repository to have it available locally:

[A12 Tutorial Application](https://github.com/mgm-tp/a12-tutorial-application)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | To follow along with the tutorials, you must use the git tags provided in each tutorial to check out the correct state of the code. Using the Project Template on its own is not sufficient, as the tutorial application includes additional configurations, models, and helper files that are specific to the tutorials and not part of the Project Template. |

### Setting up and Configuring the Application

After cloning the repository of the tutorial application, the environment and tools need to be set up and configured so that you can locally start the application.
As the tutorial application is based on the Project Template, the setup and configuration work the same.

Therefore, you just need to follow [Project Template > Environment and Tools Setup](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_environment_and_tools_setup).
You can skip the section about the installation and configuration of Docker, as it is not needed for the tutorial application.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you already have the Project Template in a compatible version successfully running, the tutorial application most likely will work out-of-the-box. If you run into any problems, please go through the instructions linked above again. |

### Running the Code

After following the instructions linked above, you can try starting the application by executing the following steps.

Firstly, you need to navigate to the root directory of the application and build all modules with:

```
gradle build
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Project Template has some code formatting and quality check tools configured and enabled out-of-the-box, specifically ESLint, Prettier and Checkstyle. These can cause the build to fail, if you made any changes that are not compliant, e.g. wrong order of the inputs.  Please see [Project Template > Code Formatting and Quality Check](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_code_formatting_and_quality_check), for more information on how to fix the findings or disable them for development purposes. |

You can then run the backend with the following Gradle task:

```
gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'
```

There are also other options available to set the Spring profile, and it is possible to run the backend from the IDE. For more information on this you can take a look at [Project Template > Running Standalone > Backend](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_backend).
All options work for the tutorial application, you just need to make sure to use the `dev-env` Spring profile.

Secondly, you need to start the frontend. For that, navigate to the client directory and start it via the following commands:

```
cd client
npm start
```

Please note that the server and client are both long-running jobs, and they will run under their respective task until you interrupt them with `Ctrl`+`C`.

Once they are both running, you can access the application on `localhost:8081` with the following credentials:

* `username`: *admin*
* `password`: *A12PT-admintest*

For an overview over all ports and available test users, please refer to [Project Template > Accessing the Application](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_accessing_the_application).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In the Project Template documentation you might have seen some mentions of Keycloak. However, this is not relevant for the tutorial application as we are using the [local authentication variant](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_local_authentication_variant) of the Project Template. |

## Navigation

### Structure

The [local authentication variant](https://geta12.com/docs/PROJECT_TEMPLATE/project-template-documentation/index.html#_local_authentication_variant) of the Project Template is used as a starting point for the development tutorials.
In the intro tutorial we will then model the basis of our CRM system and initialize the Project Template with it. Each further tutorial uses this result as a basis to add new features for additional CRM functionalities.

We currently have the following tutorials available:

* [Intro](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_intro_intro/index.html)
* [Frontend](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_frontend_intro/index.html)
* [Backend](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_backend_intro/index.html)
* [Query API](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_query_intro/index.html)
* [Workflows](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/dev_tutorial_workflows_intro/index.html)

The link between these tutorials is illustrated below:

### Navigating the Tutorials and Their Tasks

Each of the tutorials is split into multiple tasks covering various aspects of A12.

The different tutorials can be done independently of each other and every tutorial
is structured in a way that you are able to complete each task individually. For example, if you are only interested in one of the later tasks, you can start there.

This is achieved by utilizing the git tag system. For that, the repository of the tutorial application includes tags corresponding to the starting point and final result of every task in each of the tutorials for all supported versions of A12.

To begin working on a specific task, you can just check out the corresponding start tag. Similarly, you can see the solution, e.g. to see where your code differs, by checking out the end tag for that task.
So by using the provided tags, you can easily choose which tasks you want to work on, depending on what you already know or are interested in.
You can also always go back to a previous task by checking out the necessary tag.

The syntax of the tag names is always:

```
<A12_VERSION>/<TUTORIAL_NAME>/task-<NUMBER>-[start/end]
```

But you can also find the specific tag names for the start and end of each task in its corresponding documentation.

By cloning the repository, you will already have access to all the tags we provide and you can then utilize them with the following commands:

* To get a list of all available tags:

  ```
  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | ``` 1 ``` | ``` git tag ``` |
  ```
* To view the versions of files a tag is pointing to:

  ```
  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | ``` 1 ``` | ``` git checkout <tag-name> ``` |
  ```

  + To start e.g. the first task in the intro tutorial:

    ```
    git checkout 2025.06-ext5/intro/task-1-start
    ```
  + To view the end result for e.g. that task:

    ```
    git checkout 2025.06-ext5/intro/task-1-end
    ```

Please be aware that checking out a tag, will put your repository in a ["detached HEAD" state](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head), which means that "HEAD" is now pointing to a commit instead of a branch.

It is intended that after completing a task you check out the next task’s starting tag to continue, rather than carry forward your own work.
This is necessary as occasionally helper files are provided and also due to the nature of A12, small differences in the project files might mean upcoming tasks of the tutorial do not work for you.

You can utilize [git stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) or if you use IntelliJ IDEA [its shelf functionality](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/shelving-and-unshelving-changes.html) to switch between different tags without losing your local changes.

### Code Snippets

Code examples are given at various times during the tutorial. These are only snippets and not indicative of all the code in a given file.

At times a comment such as `// …​` is used to indicate missing lines in order to keep the examples shorter.
Additionally, the imports and package names are left out of the code snippets by default for better readability.

In case of any ambiguity, you can take a look at the source code on GitHub to see the full solution.
