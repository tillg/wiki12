# Project Template

## Introduction

The Project Template is meant to be used by developers who want to start an A12 project. It shows one possibility how a project can be structured, and it is always available on the latest A12 version. Its main goal is to ease the start of A12 based projects.

Out of the box, the Project Template contains Data Services, Client and Keycloak as identity provider. When you run it, you
get a client-server A12 application with access management, one Document Model, Form Model, Overview Model, and Application Model.

In addition, the configuration of Tree Engine and Relationships & Compose Document Model (CDM) are integrated into the base Project Template.

Currently, it is maintained by a dedicated development team. Please send us an
[email](mailto:a12-project-template-team@mgm-tp.com) if you start a project
using the Project Template. Feel free to contact us as well with questions, hints, suggestions and feedback by email or via [GetA12 Discourse](https://discourse.geta12.com/).

## Downloads

The following artifacts are available as downloads for the Project Template, depending on your [licensing model](https://geta12.com/#/editions-licensing):

* [Base Project Template (Community Edition)](#_download_base)
  Provides a minimal version of the project.
* Variants:

  + [Project Template with Workflows integration (Community Edition)](#_download_workflows)
    Provides a version, which integrates and uses the Workflows component.
  + [Project Template with Notification Center integration (Enterprise Edition)](#_download_notification_center)
    Provides a version, which integrates and uses the Notification Center component.
  + [Project Template with local authentication type (Community Edition)](#_download_local_auth)
    Provides a version, which uses the local authentication type of the UAA component instead of Keycloak as identity provider.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `LOCAL` authentication type is only intended for development, demonstration and training purposes. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of user management and use a different authentication type for production environments. |

## Environment and Tools Setup

It is necessary to install and configure the following tools before working with the Project Template.

### Artifactories

Most of the tools need to retrieve dependencies and require an additional setup to access them.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There are two separate Artifactories for internal and external developers, and the setup differs. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Accessing Community Edition artifacts does not require authentication. You only need to set up the registries or repositories described in the following sections in your build tools. |

#### External Partners

For externals, there is an [Artifactory on geta12.com](https://artifacts.geta12.com/) (mgm external only).

#### Internal Developers

For mgmies, there is an internal mgm Artifactory specified on mgm wiki "Tools Configuration" page in "A12" space.

### Gradle

#### Installation

| **Tool** | **Version** | **Download link** | **Installation instructions** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JDK | 21 | [Download](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) | [Installation](https://adoptium.net/installation/) | For Linux and macOS users, we recommend using SDKMAN to install and switch between JDK and Gradle versions, see [SDKMAN installation guide](https://sdkman.io/install).  For Windows, SDKMAN is only available via WSL. |
| Gradle | >=8.5.x <9 | [Download](https://gradle.org/releases/) | [Installation](https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/installation.html) | See above. |

The easiest way to confirm that Gradle is installed correctly is to run `gradle -v` and check that the Gradle version is printed.

#### Configuration

##### External Partners

Please follow the steps to [access A12 Maven artifacts](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_maven_2) and [create your identity token (if you are an enterprise user)](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_identity_token) to set up the access to the artifactory.

##### Internal Developers

Please follow the steps on mgm wiki "Tools Configuration" page in "A12" space to set up access to the artifactory.

#### Verification

You can verify that Gradle was configured correctly by running `gradle properties`. This should print an alphabetically sorted list of your Gradle configuration. If you are an enterprise user or mgmie, it should include:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` repository_password: <identity token> repository_username: <username> ``` |
```

#### Troubleshooting

Common tips for solving issues with Gradle can be found on the [Gradle troubleshooting site](https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/troubleshooting.html).

##### buildImages Task Failing on "@Input annotation" Usage

If the latest Gradle version is installed, the `buildImages` task will fail on:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` * What went wrong: A problem was found with the configuration of task ':server:init:bootBuildImage' (type 'BootBuildImage').   - In plugin 'org.springframework.boot' type 'org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.bundling.BootBuildImage' property 'archiveFile' has @Input annotation used on property of type 'RegularFileProperty'. ... ``` |
```

Please use a [supported Gradle version](#_gradle_installation).

##### buildImages Task Failing on "Connection refused"

In case you get the following error, your Docker daemon is not running properly:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':server:init:buildImages'. > com.bmuschko.gradle.docker.shaded.org.apache.hc.client5.http.HttpHostConnectException: Connect to http://127.0.0.1:2375 [/127.0.0.1] failed: Connection refused: no further information ``` |
```

Please double-check your chosen Docker tool’s setup and [troubleshoot accordingly](#_troubleshoot_docker).

##### Authentication Failed on Downloading Artifacts

Double-check, that your "repository\_username" and "repository\_password" in your Gradle configuration are correct.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | "repository\_password" [should contain an identity token](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_identity_token), **not a GetA12 password**. |

If credentials are correct, and your `gradle.properties` file contains more items, try to put lines with "repository\_username" and "repository\_password" to the top of the document.

##### Task replacePlaceholders Failed on Configuration Cache Issues

Check the `gradle.properties` file in the Project Template, if the `org.gradle.configuration-cache` is set to "false" before running the Gradle task.

If it is set to "true" it will fail the execution of the Gradle task `replacePlaceholders`, because its implementation does not support the Gradle configuration cache.

The `replacePlaceholders` is meant to be executed only once at the beginning of the project initialization, you can enable the property `org.gradle.configuration-cache` afterwards, when the Gradle task ran successfully.

##### PostgresDB Still Contains Old Data After Deleting Local Database Files

EmbeddedPostgres relies on a shutdown hook for proper cleanup, resource release, and database stopping.
This might not always work, preventing the embedded Postgres database from shutting down properly.
Even if you delete the Postgres data folder, the Postgres process might still be running in the background, which can lead to residual old data.

Consequently, restarting the application may lead to errors indicating the Postgres instance is already running, or you may face port binding issues.

If this issue occurs, you must manually stop the Postgres process and delete the temporary `server/postgres` folder.
See [Data Services - Additional Configuration Options](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_additional_possible_configuration) for more details.

### Node & npm

#### Installation

| **Tool** | **Version** | **Download link** | **Installation instructions** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node | 22.x.x | [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) | Follow installer | We recommend using nvm to install and switch between Node and npm versions, see [nvm installation guide](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/). |
| npm | >=10.7.x | [Download](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) | [Installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) | See above. |

To check that Node is installed just run `node -v` in the command line. This should return a version number.

Similarly, you can see that npm is installed with `npm -v`, which should also print a version number. Additionally, you can test your configuration with `npm config list`, which should print more details about your configuration.

By running the `checkToolVersions` Gradle task,
the versions of Node and npm installed on the system are compared with the recommended versions,
and the result is visible in the output, e.g.:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` Checking prerequisite tools versions for ... node, npm ... ... [ok] Node (version: 22.8.0) [ok] npm (version: 10.8.3) ... ``` |
```

#### Configuration

##### External Partners

Please follow the steps to [access A12 npm artifacts](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_npm_2) and [create your identity token (if you are an enterprise user)](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_identity_token) to set up the access to the artifactory.

##### Internal Developers

Please follow the steps on mgm wiki "Tools Configuration" page in "A12" space to set up access to the artifactory.

#### Verification

You can verify that Node and npm were configured correctly by running `npm config ls`. This should print a list of your npm configuration, which should, among others, include:

Internal Developers

```
|  |  |

| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` //<internal mgm Artifactory>/api/npm/:_authToken = (protected) always-auth = true email = "<Your email>" registry = "https://<internal mgm Artifactory>/api/npm/npm-repos" ``` |
```

|  | The `client:universalizePackageLock` Gradle task is specifically designed for the development of the Project Template. Its purpose is to provide a universal `package-lock.json`, independent of the artifactory configuration, with fixed dependency versions. This ensures consistency and predictability in the project’s dependencies across different environments and setups. |

#### Troubleshooting

Common tips for solving issues with Node and npm can be found on [npm common errors site](https://docs.npmjs.com/common-errors).

##### npm Invalid Auth

If you get the following message while trying to run npm commands:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` npm ERR! code ERR_INVALID_AUTH npm ERR! Invalid auth configuration found: `_auth` must be renamed to `//registry.npmjs.org/:_auth` in user config npm ERR! Please run `npm config fix` to repair your configuration.` ``` |
```

Either run `npm config fix` as suggested in the error message, or prefix your "\_auth:" line in `.npmrc` file with the artifactory URL, for example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` //<npm-artifactory-url>/:_auth="aGFoYW5hbWVuYWRodWh1cGFzcw==" ``` |
```

##### Unclear Errors After npm Version Change

If you change the npm version after you already built a client with another npm version, your build can end up with errors that are related to dependencies' versions but do not actually describe a specific problem.

In such a case, it is good practice to try to update the `package-lock.json` file by one of the following options:

* Running the command below:

  ```
  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm update ``` |
  ```
* Deleting the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file in the `client` directory. It will be created again with the next build.

##### Stopping Node Processes on Windows Manually

If the client process doesn’t stop properly, it is possible to stop the underlying Node.js runtime process manually:

1. Opening a Task Manager (either via "Start" menu or with "Ctrl+Shift+Esc" shortcut).
2. Ending all tasks named "Node.js JavaScript Runtime".

### Docker

#### Installation

| **Tool** | **Version** | **Download link** | **Installation instructions** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | 20.x | UI tool for any OS [Download](https://rancherdesktop.io/) | UI tool [Installation](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation)  [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for Linux | Rancher Desktop is linked here as a UI tool, it is possible to use different tools depending on licenses and OS.  The Docker engine installation steps include the necessary packages for the docker-compose-plugin. |
| Git | - | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Follow installer |  |

After installing your desired Docker daemon provider (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop or other), test the proper installation by running `docker version`. The result should return both "client" and "server" versions and properties, for example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` Client:  Version:           24.0.4  API version:       1.42 (downgraded from 1.43)  Go version:        go1.20.5  Git commit:        3713ee1  Built:             Fri Jul  7 14:52:09 2023  OS/Arch:           windows/amd64  Context:           default  Server:  Engine:   Version:          23.0.6   API version:      1.42 (minimum version 1.12)   Go version:       go1.20.4   Git commit:       9dbdbd4b6d7681bd18c897a6ba0376073c2a72ff   Built:            Fri May 12 13:54:36 2023   OS/Arch:          linux/amd64   Experimental:     false  containerd:   Version:          v1.7.2   GitCommit:        0cae528dd6cb557f7201036e9f43420650207b58  runc:   Version:          1.1.7   GitCommit:        860f061b76bb4fc671f0f9e900f7d80ff93d4eb7  docker-init:   Version:          0.19.0   GitCommit: ``` |
```

We have a Docker Compose setup that requires version `≥ 2.20.2` of Docker Compose. To check your Docker Compose version, run `docker compose version`. The output should display the version of Docker Compose, for example:

```
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version 2.23.1
```

We recommend using the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose to avoid compatibility issues.

#### Configuration

##### External Partners

Please follow the steps to [access A12 Docker artifacts](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_docker_2) and [create your identity token (if you are an enterprise user)](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/access_artifacts/index.html#_identity_token) to set up the access to the artifactory.

##### Internal Developers

Please follow the steps on mgm wiki "Tools Configuration" page in "A12" space to set up access to the artifactory.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Adding User To "docker-users" Group on Windows

If the Docker server is not starting properly, your user was probably not added to the "docker-users" group during installation. Try to add your user via one of the following options:

* "Computer Management" menu:

  1. From the "Start" menu, open "Computer Management" with right-click "Run as administrator".
  2. Expand "Local Users and Groups", and select "Groups".
  3. Find the docker-users group, right-click and select "Add to Group…​".
  4. Add your user account or accounts.
  5. Sign out and sign back in again for these changes to take effect.
* Command line:

  1. Run cmd with right-click "Run as administrator".
  2. Run following command with your domain and username `net localgroup docker-users DOMAIN\username /add`.

##### WSL Upgrade to WSL2 on Windows

Older computers might contain Windows Subsystem for Linux in the first version and/or with an outdated kernel.
WSL2 is necessary for Docker to run on Windows. Switch to WSL2 and update the kernel [following this Microsoft manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).

##### Gradle `composeUp` Task Fails After Renaming Project With the `replacePlaceholders` Task

If you first build the project related Docker images and **afterward** rename the project with the `replacePlaceholders` task, `composeUp` task will fail on a "pulling error" similar to these two:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` > Task :compose:composeUp  frontend Pulling  server Error  frontend Error Error response from daemon: unauthorized  > Task :compose:composeUp FAILED  > Task :compose:composeDownForcedOnFailure Warning: No resource found to remove for project "173a24ec4084261355a507f28da08f52_compose_". ``` |
```

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` > Task :compose:composeUp FAILED  frontend Pulling  server Pulling  server Error  frontend Error Error response from daemon: Get "https://my-own-dockerregistry.com/v2/": dialing my-own-dockerregistry.com:443 static system has no HTTPS proxy: resolving host my-own-dockerregistry.com: lookup my-own-dockerregistry.com: no such host  > Task :compose:composeDownForcedOnFailure Warning: No resource found to remove for project "b6e168adff81f019151d07be4954e365_compose_". ``` |
```

To fix it, perform the following steps:

1. If the project-specific Docker containers are still running, shut them down with `composeDown` Gradle task.
2. Remove existing Docker images related to the project by using `docker rmi` command or `cleanImages` Gradle task.
3. Rebuild the images with the `buildImages` Gradle task.
4. Run `composeUp` Gradle task again.

##### New `setup.json` Database Related Values Not Applied On Docker Compose Setup After Executing `replacePlaceholders` Task

When changing the initial database related values in the `setup.json` file, in case you already run compose-up the Postgres container,
they will not take effect because the Postgres database still uses a Docker volume with the old setup.
This volume persists data and configuration, including initial credentials, that will make the script `compose/postgres/db-init.sh` be ignored.

The compose-up might fail with a similar error like the following

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` 2024-08-05 10:44:44,507 WARN  [io.agroal.pool] (agroal-11) Datasource '<default>': FATAL: password authentication failed for user "my-keycloak-db-username"   2024-08-05 10:44:44,510 WARN  [org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.env.internal.JdbcEnvironmentInitiator] (JPA Startup Thread) HHH000342: Could not obtain connection to query metadata: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot throw exception because the return value of "java.util.function.BiFunction.apply(Object, Object)" is null ``` |
```

To update the database related values, you need to remove the Docker volume and compose-up the Postgres database again following these steps:

1. Run `docker volume ls` to list all Docker volumes.
2. Find the volume with the name of the project, for example `your-project-name_postgres_data`.
3. Remove the volume with `docker volume rm <volume-name>`.
4. Run `gradle postgresComposeUp` to start the Postgres database again.

Please ensure that you have a backup of the data before removing the volume.

##### Server Docker Container Crash on Mac M4 Machine

If you are using Docker Desktop on a Mac M4 machine, you might encounter an issue where the server Docker container crashes with the following error:

```

Please try updating Docker Desktop to the latest version or switching to a different base image for the server Docker container.

##### Postgresql Container Stops Unexpectedly After a Certain Amount of Time

If the postgres container stops unexpectedly after running successfully for a short period of time and the Keycloak log shows similar error:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.  * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':compose:keycloakComposeUp'. > TCP socket on 172.18.0.1:8083 of 'your-project-name_postgres' is still failing. Logs:   PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database; Skipping initialization  * Try: > Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. > Run with --scan to get full insights. > Get more help at https://help.gradle.org.  * Exception is: org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskExecutionException: Execution failed for task ':compose:keycloakComposeUp'.         at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.lambda$executeIfValid$1(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:130)         at org.gradle.internal.Try$Failure.ifSuccessfulOrElse(Try.java:293) ``` |
```

Please check your Docker installation vs. operating system network settings and behavior.
You can try to disable the TCP ports check, that is verified to help on the combination of Ubuntu with Docker Desktop. Add the `waitForTcpPorts = false` parameter to the `dockerCompose {}` closure of your project’s `compose\build.gradle`, for example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` dockerCompose {     waitForTcpPorts = false //add this line     removeVolumes = false     projectName = "${rootProject.name}"     // …. rest of the code ``` |
```

##### Docker or Docker Compose Related Errors on Linux

If you encounter Docker or Docker Compose related errors on Linux, please check the following points:

* Make sure you followed all the steps required for the [Docker engine installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
* To manage Docker as a non-root user, please check the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* If you did not proceed with full installation previously, please make sure that the Docker Compose is [installed in version 2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/releases/migrate/).

## Getting Started With the Project

Once the [environment is set up](#_environment_and_tools_setup), it is possible to download, inspect and run the project.

### Retrieving the Project

Download [Project Template 202506.5.1 (tgz archive)](https://geta12.com/#/a12-artifact/npm/@com.mgmtp.a12.projecttemplate/project-template/-/@com.mgmtp.a12.projecttemplate/project-template-202506.5.1.tgz), unarchive to a desired directory and rename the project.

### Project Content Structure

The Project Template has two main modules:

* **client** module is split into the configuration files and folders **src**, **resources** and **scripts**:

  + **resources** folder contains the main `index.html` and the other static resources like images.
  + **scripts** folder contains helper JS scripts for the project.
  + **src** consists of the custom frontend code. Containing the setup of the application, including the layout and some custom configurations, like the support of multiple locales. It also provides sagas, components and the logic to register custom modules.
* **server** module consists of two submodules, **init** and **app**:

  + **app** module contains the backend code of the Project Template, including Spring profiles for properties definitions.
  + **init** module takes care of initializing models and documents for the server application when it runs with multiple instances on a cluster environment. When the server application runs with only one instance, it can perform the initialization of models and documents itself without this init module.
    Migration tasks are also included in this submodule for data migration purposes.

The Project Template also contains complement modules:

* **compose** module contains a Docker compose configuration for development purposes, including a setup for Keycloak and Postgres containers.
* **copyright** module contains a copyright header template and helper Gradle tasks for verifying and applying headers to new files. The usage is described in the section [Licensing and License Headers](#_licensing_and_license_headers).
* **import** module contains resources that are imported to the server during initialization, for example models, JSON-RPC requests or user roles definitions. The content of the `import` directory can be modified as described in [Enhancement Possibilities](#_enhancement_possibilities). These resources are then imported to the application as follows:

  + For local development and manual Spring Boot application start, they are imported from the `import` directory. `application-dev.properties` file already contains necessary properties.
  + For local development and execution in Docker compose, the `import` directory is mounted as a volume to the server (or server-init) container.
  + For the purpose of cluster deployment, the content of `import` is zipped and published as an artifact with the same naming as published images. This artifact is then mounted to the container as a volume.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This approach serves as an example for the Project Template resources, and you need to consider changes in the deployment strategy of your project.  If your project requires different publishing cycles for different resources or finer split of published artifacts, changes in packaging and publishing tasks are necessary. |

* **buildSrc** module contains custom build logic and helper utilities for the project.
* **resources** module contains common static resources for the project, for example images.
* **quality** module contains code quality check configurations.

Besides the modules, the project contains:

* **logs** directory for the server application. This is created with the first run of the server application on the path specified in `server/app/src/main/resources/logback-prod.xml` in `file` tag. By default, it is disabled in development to avoid performance impact.
* **.run** directory contains run configuration profiles for IntelliJ IDEA.
* **.vscode** directory contains run configuration profiles for Visual Studio Code.
* **sbom** directory contains Software Bill of Materials in OWASP CycloneDX standard format of the project: `cyclonedx-client.json` and `cyclonedx-server.json`.

### Frequently Used Commands

The following list contains a collection of the most important commands to interact with the Project Template:

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `gradle clean build` | Build the project. |
| `gradle :server:app:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'` | Start the Data Services Server. |
| `cd client`  `npm start` | Start the frontend. |
| `gradle buildImages` | Build Docker images. |
| `gradle composeUp` | Start Docker containers. |
| `gradle buildImagesComposeUp` | Build images and start Docker containers with one command. |
| `gradle composeDown` | Stop running Docker containers. |
| `gradle keycloakComposeUp` | Starting the Keycloak and Postgres container. Keycloak is connected to Postgres to persist data. |
| `gradle keycloakComposeDown` | Stopping the Keycloak and Postgres container. |
| `gradle replacePlaceholders` | Replacing all placeholder template names based on `setup.json`. |
| `gradle checkToolVersions` | Compares provided tool versions to the required ones based on `tool-versions.json`. |

### Ready-to-Use Functionality

The following features are fully integrated into the base Project Template. This means you can start leveraging these features without any additional configuration.

#### Tree Engine

You can refer to this [Tree Engine](https://geta12.com/docs/tree_engine/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html) for more details on Tree Engine.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You will need to add your own custom modules and models. |

#### Relationship and Composed Document Model

You can refer to this [Modeling Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/relationships_for_bas/index.html) for more details on CDM.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You will need to add your own custom modules and models. |

#### Content engine

You can refer to this [Content Engine](https://geta12.com/docs/CONTENT_ENGINE/contentengine-dev-docs/index.html) for more details on Content Engine.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You will need to add your own custom modules and models. |

#### Typed Accessor Classes

The typed accessor classes are generated during the build process of the server application. For more details, please refer to [Typed Accessors Documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/KERNEL/kernel-documentation-dev/generated_typed_accessors)

To enable the generation of typed accessor classes, you might need to adapt the `runTypedAccessorGenerator` task configuration within the `build.gradle` file of the `server/app` module according to your project’s structure:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` tasks.register("runTypedAccessorGenerator", JavaExec) {     ...     def modelPath = "${rootProject.projectDir.path}/import/models";     def packagePrefix = "com.mgmtp.a12.template.server.typings"     def documentModels = fileTree(dir: "${modelPath}", include: '**/*_DM.json')     ... } ``` |
```

The following is how the generated folder looks like in the project structure:

![typed accessor classes IDE](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/typed-accessor-classes-IDE.png)

## File Naming Convention

The Project Template follows a specific file naming convention to ensure consistency and clarity across the project. Below are the guidelines for naming files:

| **File Type** | **Naming Convention** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript node script (`.js`) | Use kebab-case | `kill-port.js` |
| TypeScript (`.ts`) | Use camelCase | `appsetup.ts` |
| React Components, React Context (`.tsx`) | Use PascalCase | `ThemeChooser.tsx`, `ThemeContext.tsx` |
| Java files (`.java`) | Use PascalCase | `UserService.java`, `ServerApplication.java` |
| Shell scripts | Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case) | `build.sh`, `run-tests.sh` |

## Preparation of the Project Template for a New Project

This section covers the changes necessary for using the Project Template in a new project.

### Initialization

After unpacking and understanding the project structure, we suggest initializing version control of your choice for the repository. The following example describes initialization for Git.

In the project folder, execute these commands:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` # Init repository git init  # Create first commit git add --all git commit -m "Initial Commit" ``` |
```

Eventually, you can add your remote repository and push the first commit there:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` # Add new origin remote git remote add origin <your-repository-url>  # Push the initial commit git push -u origin HEAD:main ``` |
```

### Renaming

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is not mandatory to rename the project for initial build or local development. In case you plan to publish your project, you should replace these values with your desired project-specific ones. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure there is no persisted data before you use `replacePlaceholders` task to change model’s names, e.g. change the values of `appModelName` property. We support Postgres file-based and local Postgres for database configuration, and both work on persistence mechanism. If there are some issues like displaying double App Model, you should delete the files in the `server/postgres` folder. |

The Project Template contains placeholders like "your-project-name" for a project name in multiple places. These can be replaced automatically by a Gradle task following these steps:

1. Make sure you’re in the **project root directory** and that [Gradle](#_gradle) is set.
2. Make sure **no Docker images** for the project exist. If some exist already, remove it by using `docker rmi` command or with `cleanImages` gradle task.
3. All parameters that would be replaced are centralized in `setup.json`. Put your desired name values to the `alternative` fields in the file. It is not needed to change all the `alternative` fields, if you know you will not use some of it.

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | To avoid unexpected field changes, please don’t change `current` field values if you have no purposeful reason for it. |

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | We can not support all characters for `alternative` values. Single quotes (') are not supported and may lead to errors when e.g. included in database password placeholders. |
4. Run `replacePlaceholders` Gradle task

All placeholder values should now be replaced with the alternative values.
For the package group name changes, files in `server/../src` directory are moved to the newly created directories in the path corresponding with the new group name.

### Docker Related Adjustments for External Developers

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This section is only for external developers. The following changes are also required for participating in the [A12 Technical Introduction Training](https://geta12.com/#/trainings/training-dev). |

The Docker setup in the Project Template needs the following changes if it relies on an external registry.

#### Change Docker Registry Properties

The `gradle.properties` file in the root directory of the project contains properties that define Docker registries:

* **For publish** - registry where your project’s images will be published once it is ready to be published. It has to be a secured non-public registry or service.
* **For read** - registry where the necessary public images like "postgres" will be pulled from.

Both registries are pre-set to `docker.io` as a default. You may need to change `dockerRegistryForPublish` to your own secured registry as shown here:

From

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` dockerRegistryForPublish=docker.io dockerRegistryForRead=docker.io ``` |
```

To

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` dockerRegistryForPublish=your-project-name.<YOUR-DOCKER-REGISTRY> dockerRegistryForRead=docker.io ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is unnecessary to have a Docker registry for publishing and to change `dockerRegistryForPublish` for the purpose of the [A12 Technical Introduction Training](https://geta12.com/#/trainings/training-dev). |

If you set up your own secured `dockerRegistryForPublish`, also set `dockerUseCredentials` to `true`, like this:

From

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` dockerUseCredentials=false ``` |
```

To

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` dockerUseCredentials=true ``` |
```

#### Set the Keycloak’s Registry

Keycloak does not use "docker.io" as its public registry for images. Its registry is set up in `compose/.env` and is pre-set to the public Keycloak registry `quay.io`. If you need to use your own registry instead, change it as shown here:

From

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` KEYCLOAK_REGISTRY='quay.io' ``` |
```

To

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` KEYCLOAK_REGISTRY='<YOUR-DOCKER-REGISTRY>' ``` |
```

#### Docker Host Changes

In case your environment requires changes on Docker host port or address, uncomment and edit the `dockerHost` property in the `gradle.properties` file.
This is useful if you are running Docker inside WSL, for example. You can expose your Docker daemon and use the IP address of your WSL in this property.

### Certificate Authentication

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Certificate authentication type is integrated into Workflows and Notification Center variants. |

Certificate authentication is provided by UAA, it is used for backend jobs that are executed without user interaction.
The certificate is validated by a Root Authority(CA) and contains information like system’s name and user’s role.

We provide a Gradle task to generate a server and a client certificate:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle genCert ``` |
```

This task creates the following files:

* `rootCA.crt`: Added in DataServices module. This certificate is used by the UAA Server to verify the `client.crt`.
* `client.crt`: Imported into extra modules, such as Workflows or Notification Center.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Users **MUST** run the `gradle genCert` task manually to generate certificates first as a prerequisite, otherwise the application can’t start.  The information in certificates is set by default and serves for development purposes only. For production usage, or if users want to implement their own certificates, please refer to the [UAA Certificate](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html#CertificateAuthentication) documentation. |

## Build

With the project [prepared](#_preparation_of_the_project_template_for_a_new_project) and environment [set up](#_environment_and_tools_setup), the source is ready to be built from the root directory of the project.
The build is provided by the Gradle Build Tool.

### Project Modules

All modules can be built together with one Gradle task:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle build ``` |
```

Alternatively, it is possible to build modules separately, for example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :client:build ``` |
```

### Docker Images

The Docker images can be built together as well:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle buildImages ``` |
```

Or every image can be built separately, e.g.:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:buildImages ``` |
```

Additionally, we provide an option to build all images and [run all containers](#_running_with_docker) with one command:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle buildImagesComposeUp ``` |
```

For the server, based on [this Spring Boot Docker Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker), the images are built with the Spring Boot layer index approach.

## Run

### Running With Docker

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure your Docker is [set up](#_docker) properly. |

We leverage [Gradle Docker-compose plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin)  to simplify the process of composing the project with Docker-compose. In `compose/build.gradle`, we provide a set of tasks to start and stop Docker-compose services. For more details, please refer to the plugin’s documentation.

| **Command** | **Description** | **Started services** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gradle composeUp` | Once project images are [built](#_docker_images), we can run the entire project at once. | Postgres, Keycloak, Server, Frontend |
| `gradle serverInitComposeUp` | This is similar to the `composeUp` task, but it additionally starts the server-init container, which is typically used for initializing databases, sending data, or performing other setup tasks before the main application services start. | Postgres, Keycloak, Frontend, Server Init ➡ Server |
| `gradle noClientComposeUp` | Run server-side components only. | Postgres, Keycloak, Server |
| `gradle postgresComposeUp` | Run the Postgres container specifically, serving development purposes. | Postgres |
| `gradle keycloakComposeUp` | Run the Keycloak container specifically, with data persisted in the Postgres container. | Postgres and Keycloak |

Containers should be stopped by the `*Down` task variant of the same name. For example, you can stop all containers at once with:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle composeDown ``` |
```

Or to stop all containers started by the `serverInitComposeUp` task, use the corresponding "down" task variant:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle serverInitComposeDown ``` |
```

### Running Standalone

For development purposes, it might be more convenient to run backend and frontend services separately as a batch job.

#### Standalone Keycloak

The application expects Keycloak to be running (on port 8089 by default), so a standalone Keycloak container is a prerequisite of the next steps. Run it with:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle keycloakComposeUp ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Project Template’s Keycloak setup is for development purposes only. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of a Keycloak instance for production environments. You can find more details regarding the configuration in the [UAA Keycloak documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html#keycloak) and more details on security in the [Security Guidelines](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/security/index.html#_checklist_keycloak). |

#### Authorization Introspector

Project Template provides a minimal configuration for the UAA Authorization Introspector. The configuration is placed in `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties`, which declares the endpoints to be whitelisted for introspection:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` mgmtp.a12.uaa.authorization.web.introspection.whitelist-endpoints=/error,/api/uaa-authentication/currentUser,/cs/download/{id},/api/internal/seed-data ``` |
```

For more information about the UAA Authorization Introspector, please refer to the [UAA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html#_authorization_introspection) on this topic.

#### Backend

There are two options for running the backend. While running it via a Gradle task is more straightforward, running it via an IDE brings more options for debugging when you are developing.
Both options use Spring profiles for additional configuration possibilities.

The [Spring Boot Devtools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.0/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools) is enabled by default, the application automatically restarts when changes are detected in the classpath. This significantly reduces the turnaround time during development.

##### Spring Profiles

There are three aggregated Spring profiles in `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application.properties`:

* **dev-env** - It’s the first-choice profile for development.
* **local-db-env** - Works exactly the same as the aggregated **dev-env** profile but is configured with external postgres.
* **cluster-safe-env** - Aggregated for cluster mode, which means all initialization scripts are disabled.

You can find more profiles and detailed descriptions in the [Configuration section](#configuration_profiles).

There are several options to set your Spring profile (the first two are recommended). The "dev-env" as the most suitable profile for local development is used in the examples of these options below:

* Use every Gradle bootrun command with an `--args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'` parameter.
* Add `spring.profiles.active=dev-env` to the bottom of your `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application.properties` file.
* If the parameter approach is not working, Unix users can try to set the environment property, for example:

  ```
  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` # Set the property export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev-env  # Run the task without parameters gradle :server:app:bootrun ``` |
  ```

##### Running With Gradle Task

You can run the server application with a Gradle task, in the example already parametrized with the "dev-env" profile:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env' ``` |
```

It is a long-running job, and the server application will run under this task until you interrupt it with `Ctrl + C`.

##### Running From IDE

IntelliJ IDEA is set up by a configuration in the `.run` directory.

If you need to set up the run configuration manually, it is necessary to:

1. Add desired Spring profiles.
2. Specify the working directory as `server/app`.
3. Remove "Add dependencies with provided scope to classpath" option.

![IDE setup](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/IDE-setup.png)

Run the class annotated with `@DataServicesApplication` in the respective module:

![IDE run](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/IDE-run.png)

This allows running each service in debug mode.

#### Frontend

The frontend application can be run in a long-running task via `npm`, described in the following example.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For the following steps, make sure you’re inside a `client/` directory containing a `package.json` file and that npm is set up to [use the A12 Artifactory](#_npm_configuration). |

"Install" and "compile" steps are included if you run the gradle "build" task, so repeating it is only necessary after code changes.

| **Step** | **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install | `npm install` | Install all npm dependencies. |
| Compile | `npm run compile` | Compile the npm project. |
| Run | `npm start` | Once the client application is successfully compiled, start the frontend application (using Webpack).  It is a long-running job, and the client application will run under this task until you interrupt it with `Ctrl + C`. |

### Accessing the Application

Once running, services are exposed on the following ports by default:

| **Service** | **Port** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | `:8081` | Runs in Docker or standalone. |
| Project Template Server | `:8082` | Runs in Docker or standalone. |
| Postgres | `:8083` | Runs in Docker only. |
| Keycloak | `:8089` | Runs in Docker only. |

The frontend is running and accessible on <http://localhost:8081>.

There are three test users to log in:

| **user** | **password** | **role** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | `A12PT-admintest` | Admin |
| `user1` | `A12PT-user1test` | User |
| `user2` | `A12PT-user2test` | User |

For detailed description of users' roles and permissions, please read the [Document Ownership](#_document_ownership) section.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Project Template’s login setup is for development purposes only. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of logins and user management for production environments. You can find more details on configuration in the [UAA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html) and more details on security in the [Security Guidelines](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/security/index.html#_checklist_keycloak). |

### Running Init Application

The init application takes care of initializing models and documents for the server application. This is especially useful when running an application with multiple instances on a cluster environment. Migration tasks are also included in this submodule for data migration example purposes.

#### Spring Profiles

In the `server/init` submodule, the application enables two aggregated Spring profiles, which are placed in `server/init/src/main/resources/config/application.properties`:

* **dev-env**: This is the standard profile for local development.
* **local-db-env**: Same usage as **dev-env**, but it is configured with external Postgres instead of Postgres in file by default.

The application also provides some additional profiles:

* **init-data**: Contains configuration of initialization scripts, like RPC requests.
* **shared**: Contains shared properties between profiles for logging and data migration.

#### Running Commands

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `gradle :server:init:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env,init-data'` | Starts the Data Services Server, runs  JSON-RPC requests with data stored in the `import/data` directory and is terminated after initialization. |
| `gradle serverInitComposeUp` | Starts the `server-init` container. |
| `gradle serverInitComposeDown` | Stops the `server-init` container. |

Users can also run `server/init` run configurations from IDE. Currently only IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code are supported. They are configured in `.run` and `.vscode`:

* init app start (postgres-in-file)
* init app start (local-db)

#### Best Practices

For production purposes, it is not desired to run `initialization` phase everytime the server is started.
Therefore, the `init` application is used to serve data initialization/migration. These use cases can be applied into this app:

* Database migration: should be run in case of database changes.
* Model import: In case of models change or for the first time.
* Data migration: [Migrate data](#_data_migration_support) by `MigrationStep` extension point.
* Execution of custom JSON-RPC requests: May be used for document import.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive the following error when starting the server application:

```

## Development Tips

### Versioning

The version of the Project Template is derived from `a12ReleaseLine` in `gradle.properties` (e.g., 2025.06).
Gradle build uses this as the default version for all subprojects. If the `-PreleaseVersion` parameter is defined with Gradle build, then the version from the parameter is used.

### A12 Dependencies

It is possible to set the same version for different maven artifacts of the same A12 product in `settings.gradle`. Keep in mind that this does not work for npm artifacts of A12 products; these need to be set in `client/package.json`.
The usage can be seen in the `build.gradle` files as follows:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ```     // Native BOMs     implementation(platform(a12Libs.base.bom))     implementation(platform(a12Libs.kernel.bom))     implementation(platform(a12Libs.uaa.bom))     implementation(platform(a12Libs.dataservices.bom)) ``` |
```

### Keycloak Realms

Project Template uses the "A12Realm" realm for Keycloak as the default configuration.

To manage the realm configuration, users, roles and more, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your Keycloak container is running.
2. Open "Administration Console", by default at <http://localhost:8089>.
3. Login with admin/admin credentials (only in dev mode).

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | Project Template’s login setup is for development purposes only. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of logins and user management for production environments. You can find more details on configuration in the [UAA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html) and more details on security in the [Security Guidelines](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERALL/security/index.html#_checklist_keycloak). |
4. Select "A12Realm" and modify it according to your needs.

### Backend

Getting familiar with the [Data Services documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html) is the ideal start of the backend development and server code changes.

#### Extensions

The Spring Boot distribution artifacts of backend services allow setting up project-specific Spring Boot applications with custom extensions and configurations.
To register your own implementations or extensions, add your code under `src/main/java` as with any Spring Boot application.

You may need to add the `@ComponentScan` annotation for Spring Boot to include your extensions.

If your project uses a package different from `com.mgmtp.a12.template`, it is sufficient to add it to `@DataServicesApplication(scanBasePackages…​)` in `ServerApplication`, for example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` @DataServicesApplication(scanBasePackages = {DataServicesApplication.DATASERVICES_BASE_PACKAGE, "com.mgmtp.a12.template", "another.path.xy"}) ``` |
```

#### Spring Profile Edits

Customising [Spring profile properties](#_run_spring_profiles) brings a lot of enhancement possibilities for development. All properties are described in the [Data Services Configuration documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#dataservices-configuration).

#### Logging

A12 uses logback with Slf4j for logging and can be configured according to the needs of your project. The Project Template provides an example logback configuration in `server/app/src/main/resources/logback-dev.xml` and `server/app/src/main/resources/logback-prod.xml` with security and GDPR in mind.

The configuration files serve the following purposes:

* `logback-dev.xml`: Is used for the development environment and logs the output in clear format.
* `logback-prod.xml`: Should be used in a production environment and logs the output in JSON format.

The `ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender` controls logging to STDOUT. Additionally, logs are written into files with the `ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender` and an example log rolling policy.

For both appenders, the log pattern is configured to not include the MDC (Mapping Diagnostic Context), because this would add sensitive information (e.g. username) into the log messages. Also, both use the `net.logstash.logback.encoder.LoggingEventCompositeJsonEncoder` to produce log entries in the JSON format. The JSON format is recommended, because it prevents log injection and is easier to handle in log post-processing.

More information about logback configuration can be found at <https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html>.

### Frontend

You may implement your own A12 Client application here from scratch or adjust the example application. Getting familiar with the [Client documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/CLIENT/client-documentation-bundle/index.html) is the ideal start of the fronted development.

#### IDE Setup

Both VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA/WebStorm are supported.

##### Code Formatting and Quality Check

We are using Prettier, ESLint, and Checkstyle to enforce some (but not all) code conventions and cleanliness.

###### ESLint

* **IntelliJ IDEA/WebStorm**: In Settings → Languages & Frameworks → JavaScript → Code Quality Tools → ESLint, make sure "Automatic ESLint configuration" is checked.
* **VSCode**: ESLint is packaged together with VSCode, so no additional configuration is required.

We also recommend enabling the format on a save option in the ESLint settings to keep your files always formatted.

Alternatively, you can fix ESLint check errors by running:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm run lint:fix ``` |
```

###### Prettier

See the instruction links below to set up Prettier in your favorite IDEs:

* **IntelliJ IDEA/WebStorm**: [WebStorm Setup](https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html) (includes setup for IntelliJ IDEA)
* **VSCode**: [Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

Alternatively, you can fix Prettier check errors by running:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm run format:fix ``` |
```

###### Checkstyle

The Checkstyle plugin performs quality checks on your project’s Java source files using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.
Run Checkstyle against the Java source files by this command:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle checkstyleMain ``` |
```

###### Disabling Code Quality Checks for Builds

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Only for development purposes. The following commands will skip the validation of ESLint, Prettier and Checkstyle. |

| **tool** | **command** |
| --- | --- |
| npm | `npm run skip:lint-format-compile` |
| Gradle | `gradle build -PskipLintFormat=true` |
| Gradle | `gradle build -PskipCheckstyle=true` |

Alternatively, it’s also possible to set the property `skipLintFormat` or `skipCheckstyle` to `true` on project-level in the `gradle.properties` file.

###### Java Sources Searching With IntelliJ IDEA

* Enable Downloading Java Sources

To ensure that your IDE downloads Java sources for Gradle libraries automatically, the `idea` plugin has been configured by default in the root `build.gradle`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` idea {     module {         downloadSources = true     } } ``` |
```

All library sources should be indexed, you can now search for A12 API within `project and libraries` scope as follows:

![javasources project and libraries scope intellij search](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/javasources-project-and-libraries-scope-intellij-search.png)

* Search Scope for A12 Libraries

To improve the search for Java sources and only include A12 libraries, you can define a custom scope.

1. Go to **Settings/Preferences** > **Appearance & Behavior** > **Scopes**.
2. Add a new scope, e.g. `A12`.
3. Define the pattern to include A12 libraries (e.g., `lib:com.mgmtp.a12..*`).
4. Apply the changes, and now you can use this scope in various IDE features like "Find in Files".

![a12 scope intellij search](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/a12-scope-intellij-search.png)

For more details, please refer to the [Defining Scopes in IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-scopes.html) documentation.

Note for VSCode users, you can use [Search For Symbols](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-editing#_search-for-symbols) in VSCode to find definitions across your workspace. However, VSCode does not support sophisticated searching within library sources as IntelliJ IDEA does.

#### React and Redux Developer Tools

As with the IDE, you can also use any browser. We use Chrome for the development of the Project Template.
Familiarize yourself with the React and Redux browser extensions, they are essential to inspect your application’s UI and backend state:

* React Extension: [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
* Redux Extension: [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

#### Hot Module Replacement (HMR) with Fast Refresh

The Project Template uses Webpack HMR with Fast Refresh to enable instant code updates without full page reloads during development.

##### Overview

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is Webpack’s mechanism for swapping modules at runtime without a full page reload. However, HMR alone cannot properly update React components because it doesn’t know how to re-render them or preserve their state.

**Fast Refresh** builds on HMR to enable editing React components without losing their state.

| **Change Type** | **Behavior** |
| --- | --- |
| React components (`.tsx`) | Instant update, state preserved |
| Files only imported by React components (utils, hooks, constants) | Instant update, state preserved (Fast Refresh propagates through importing components) |
| Files imported outside the React tree (`appsetup.ts`, module `index.ts`) | Full page refresh |

##### Configuration

Fast Refresh is configured in `client/webpack.dev.js` as shown below:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require("@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin"); const ReactRefreshTypeScript = require("react-refresh-typescript");  module.exports = merge(common, {     module: {         rules: [{             test: /\.tsx?$/,             use: [{                 loader: "ts-loader",                 options: {                     getCustomTransformers: () => ({                         before: [ReactRefreshTypeScript()]                     }),                     transpileOnly: true                 }             }]         }]     },     plugins: [         new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()     ] }); ``` |
```

##### Module Auto-Discovery

Custom A12 modules are automatically discovered using Webpack’s `require.context` in `client/src/modules/index.ts`.
To add a module, create a folder with an `index.ts` that exports a default `Module` object — no manual imports needed.

##### Verifying HMR with Fast Refresh

When you modify a React component file, you can verify HMR with Fast Refresh is working by checking the browser console:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` [HMR] Updated modules: [HMR]  - ./src/modules/person/components/PersonOverview.tsx [HMR] App is up to date. ``` |
```

## Connecting to Databases

The Project Template uses PostgreSQL as the default database. It can be run either in a Postgres Docker container or as an embedded Postgres database in file.

You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using any compatible client tool:

* **IntelliJ IDE**: Use the built-in Database Tools and SQL plugin (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate) or DataGrip
* **Visual Studio Code**: Use the [PostgreSQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-ossdata.vscode-pgsql)

### PostgreSQL Docker Container

The `gradle keycloakComposeUp` command automatically starts a PostgreSQL container. However, if you want to start the Postgres container separately, use the `gradle postgresComposeUp` command.

**Connection Details:**

* **Port**: 8083
* **Configuration File**: `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-local-db.properties`

**Starting the Server:**

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local-db-env' ``` |
```

Alternatively, use the "server start (local-db)" run configuration in your IDE.

#### IntelliJ IDEA / DataGrip Connection Setup

Configure two separate database connections with the parameters shown in the screenshots below:

![IntelliJ connect ds db](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/IntelliJ-connect-ds-db.png)

![IntelliJ connect cs db](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/IntelliJ-connect-cs-db.png)

#### Visual Studio Code Connection Setup

**Step 1:** Create a server group to organize your database connections (optional).

![VSCode create server group](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/VSCode-create-server-group.png)

**Step 2:** Create two database connections with the following parameters:

* Data Services database connection

![VSCode connect ds db](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/VSCode-connect-ds-db.png)

* Content Store database connection

![VSCode connect cs db](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/VSCode-connect-cs-db.png)

### PostgreSQL In-File (Embedded) Database

**Starting the Server:**

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env' ``` |
```

Alternatively, use the "server start (postgres-in-file)" run configuration in your IDE.

**Connection Details:**

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Host** | localhost |
| **Port** | 5434 |
| **User** | postgres |
| **Password** | *(no password required)* |

#### IntelliJ IDEA / DataGrip Connection Setup

![IntelliJ connect db in file](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/IntelliJ-connect-db-in-file.png)

#### Visual Studio Code Connection Setup

![VSCode connect db in file](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/VSCode-connect-db-in-file.png)

## CI/CD

### CI/CD Jenkins Pipelines in Project Template

We provide an example Jenkins pipeline to speed up the project CI/CD setup.
The usage of Jenkins pipelines related to the Project Template is described in detail in the project’s `README`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Before using the Jenkinsfile in the project, it is necessary to go through all the `//TODO` marks and adapt related code to fit your deployment environment needs. |

## Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

The [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) directive allows amongst others reducing the threat of Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in modern browsers. These directives are set via HTTP header attributes.

**Recommendations**:

* For responses with HTML content, CSP should be set to include at least: `default-src 'self'; connect-src: 'self'; base-uri: 'self'`. Other directives can be added and expanded according to actual requirements.
  Unsafe settings for sources (e.g. `script-src`) like https: or `'inline-script'` should be avoided.
* For API responses that use the JSON content type, consider setting `default-src: 'none'`.

### Attachment Upload Restrictions

It is recommended to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded as attachments by their [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).
In the Project Template, this restriction is applied in the form comma-separated list of MIME types in the `server/app/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties`. Adapt the list according to your project needs:

* Explicitly list all allowed MIME types.
* List allowed MIME type groups by using asterisk, for example `image/*`.
* Decrease the security level by disabling the MIME type restriction. It is possible to use asterisk as a value of the property or to delete the property for this.

### Reload Authorization Rules

UAA supports the reloading of authorization definition rules during runtime.

The Project Template contains the required configuration and an additional access right `RELOAD_AUTH_RULES`. This access right allows users with the role `systemAdmin` to be authorized to send the request for reloading the authorization rules.

The implementation of this security feature can be found in `import/auth/childAuthorizationDefinition.json`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is no user out-of-the-box available with the `systemAdmin` role. In order to use this functionality, it is necessary to create a dedicated user.  In production environments, the reload of the authorization rules has to be triggered for every node on the cluster. |

For more information about reloading authorization rules, please refer to the [UAA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html#reload-authorization-rules) on this topic.

## Licensing and License Headers

Every source and configuration file in the Project Template carries a copyright header that describes [A12 Dual licensing](https://geta12.com/#/editions-licensing) usage.
The header text is maintained in `copyright/copyright-template.md`.

Projects based on the Community Edition are obliged to follow the [EUPL License](https://eupl.eu/1.2/en/) rules for project files header usage.

Enterprise Edition users should follow their proprietary license rules for project file headers.

### Copyright Headers Gradle Tasks

Two Gradle tasks manage license headers across all project files (excluding build output and `node_modules`):

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle validateCopyrightHeaders ``` |
```

Checks every covered source file for a copyright header that matches the template.
It is automatically wired into `gradle check` (and therefore `gradle build`), so a missing, mismatched, or outdated header will fail the build.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` gradle updateCopyrightHeaders ``` |
```

Adds the header to files that are missing it, updates the copyright year and replaces any header that no longer matches the template.
Run this task after adding new source files or at the start of a new calendar year.

#### Usage

Adapt the header template according to your project license and needs, then run `gradle updateCopyrightHeaders` task to apply the new template to project files.

If you decide to use another way of maintaining the license headers, or your specific enterprise license agreement does not require it, it is possible to prevent Gradle tasks from checking the headers by:

1. removing the `apply from: 'copyright/copyright.gradle'` and `check.dependsOn('validateCopyrightHeaders')` lines from the root `build.gradle` file
2. removing the `copyright` directory

## Enhancement Possibilities

This chapter contains examples of possible enhancements and extensions of the Project Template.

### Adding New Custom Module in Code

The following steps describe the import of the models created in the SME:

1. Create a new folder in `import/models/<modulename>`.

   1. Copy models and subdirectories with models from your SME workspace to this folder.
2. Create a new folder in `client/src/modules/<modulename>`.

   1. Create a new file named `index.ts` in `client/src/modules/<modulename>/`.
   2. Update the content of `client/src/modules/<modulename>/index.ts`:

      1. The content should be as follows:

         ```
         |  |  |
         | --- | --- |
         | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` import { Module } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  const module: Module = {     id: "myNewModule" };  export default module; ``` |
         ```
      2. Change the id of the module from `"myNewModule"` to `"<modulename>Module"`.

         Changes to React components will benefit from **HMR with Fast Refresh** - updates appear instantly without page reload and state is preserved. See [Hot Module Replacement (HMR) with Fast Refresh](#_hot_module_replacement_hmr) for more details.
3. Run `npm run format:fix` in the `client` directory.
4. Run `gradle clean build` in the root directory of the project.
5. Start the Data Services server.
6. Start the client.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure that the App Models' filenames are meaningful and represent the respective models in the `import/models` folder. E.g., "Person\_AM" filename for the "Person-XYZ" models. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you don’t need original files (e.g., a Person module), you can remove them:  1. Delete all unwanted models in `import/models/`. 2. Delete all unwanted request files in `import/data/request`. |

### Adding Custom Theme

In order to add a custom theme to the Project Template, follow these steps:

* Place a new theme JSON file in the `client/src/themes` folder. The loader expects a file with the `.json` extension.
* Name the file meaningfully, e.g., `my-dark-theme.json`. The application will convert the filename to a display name (e.g., "my-dark-theme.json" will be displayed as "My Dark Theme" in the theme selector).
* Content of the theme JSON file should follow the interface `DefaultThemeType`, or you can refer to [Widgets Theming](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/basics/theme/theming).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The theme loader can serve multiple themes. Each theme must be in a separate JSON file. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The theme name `flat` is reserved by the default flat theme. Using this name for a custom theme will override the default flat theme instead of adding a new option to the theme selector. |

## Working With the SME

### Model Deployment

The SME provides functionality to [deploy models](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-ba-docs/index.html#model_deployment) during runtime.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It’s necessary that the Project Template application including Keycloak, Client, and Server are running before models can be deployed. |

#### Configuring a Web SME

To configure this for the Project Template, changes in Keycloak are necessary.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The web SME used in the example requires access to the mgm internal infrastructure (mgm internal only). If your project has a deployed SME instance, set the respective URl in the following property. |

Walk through the following steps to configure your Keycloak instance, to accept deployment requests from the web SME:

1. Go to your running Keycloak instance under `localhost:8089`.
2. Log in with "admin/admin" credentials.
3. Select the "A12Realm" in the top-left corner dropdown.
4. Go to **Clients** → **a12-spa-client**.
5. Add your web SME URL to **Valid redirect URIs** and **Valid post logout redirect URIs**.
6. Click the btn:[Save] button.

### Deploying Models

Go to your SME and configure your server connection and set the values as follows:

* **Authentication Type**: "OIDC"
* **URL**: "http://localhost:8082/api/"
* **OIDC URL**: "http://localhost:8089/realms/A12Realm"
* **Client**: "a12-spa-client"

Afterward, login with the "admin/A12PT-admintest" user credentials.

After logging in, the Keycloak screen will disappear and a notification about the successful login will be displayed.

### Deploying the Seed Data

The Project Template, if run with the dev properties, is preconfigured to work with the [Seed Data](https://geta12.com/docs/SME/sme-data-ba-docs/index.html).
This feature helps to create initial data in the SME and deploy it to your application server. This data can be documents, relationship links, attachments, roles and users.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Seed Data for Users does not work with the Keycloak, thus it can be only used with the [Local Authentication variant](#_local_authentication_variant) of the Project Template. Other types of Seed Data work with all variants of the Project Template. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Seed Data related operations, endpoints and data are not intended for production environment usage. It serves for development and testing purposes and does not provide security features required for production use cases. |

### Importing a Workspace

If you want to start with a new project containing completely new models, clean the project from current models and data and add new models with the following steps.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure there is no persisted application data. If you already started the application previously with different models, you have to clean the persisted data with one of these two options:  1. Clean the persistent storage:  * If you ran the application Postgres file-based, delete the `server/postgres` folder.    * If you ran the application with a local Postgres database configuration, delete the database and create it again.    * If you ran the application with the Postgres Docker container:  + Delete the container and the image, either automatically with `gradle composeDown`, or with `docker rm` command.      + Find and delete the related Docker volume with `docker volume ls` and `docker volume rm` commands. 2. Remove only the data from the storage:  * Remove models with the help of [DELETE Model REST API endpoint](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#rest_delete_model), or with the help of [initialization import properties](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#full-model-import).    * Remove documents within the application or with related [JSON RPC operations](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#rpc_delete_document).    * Attachments without a reference will be deleted automatically by the [cleanUpDirtyAttachmentsJob](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#_provided_jobs). |

1. Remove old models in `import/models`.
2. Remove old requests in `import/data/request`.
3. Move all prepared models of your workspace from the SME to `import/models` and adjust the following:

   1. The roles, which are used in the models, must match the roles that are defined in the Project Template (and Keycloak). If that is not the case, replace the roles in your models with the default values used in the Project Template: `admin, user`.
   2. All the View Engines you define in the App Model Scenes must be included and match the keys in the `enginesViewMap` constant in `client/src/app/EnginesViewMap.tsx`, and each must be registered via a corresponding `addView()` call in `client/src/appsetup.ts`.

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      |  | Make sure the App Models' filenames are meaningful and represent the respective models in the `import/models` folder. E.g., "Person\_AM" filename for the "Person-XYZ" models. |
4. Delete unnecessary `server/init/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/template/server/init/migration/PersonMigration.java`. If you want to keep it as an example for future reference, make sure `mgmtp.a12.dataservices.initialization.migration.enabled` in `server/init/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties` is set to `false`.
5. If you added View Engines, or modified client code another way, run `npm run format:fix` in the `client` directory.
6. Start the server and the client.

## Data Migration Support

Every project will sooner or later face the situation, where they modify their Document Models (e.g., changing the field type or removing an existing field).
To make this more accessible for new projects, the Project Template provides an example of a document migration. Example structure and a small sample migration task for executing data migration via `MigrationStep` extension point is placed in the `server/init` path.

We convert the document to a JSON Node and modify it while performing the data migration instead of using Kernel functionality.
It is necessary to ensure that the document is valid and deserializable after migration, which has the following consequences:

* These migration steps are for migrating documents from `version A` to `version B`, where `version A` is not valid anymore because we have new models compliant with `version B`.
  So in the `MigrationStep` you must make sure that documents are valid for `version B` if you want to migrate them.
* Using the Kernel implementation creates an issue here, because documents are not deserializable anymore due to the mismatch between the document and the new Document Model.
  The solution is to modify the content of the documents after loading it from the repository to fit the new models before the documents are being deserialized.

Please refer to the [Data Services documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/DATA_SERVICES/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#data-migration-support) to get more information.

### Instructions

In the Project Template, the example for the data migration is based on the following overall steps:

1. A new package is added to the `server/init` under `server/init/src/main/java/com/mgmtp/a12/template/server/migration`.
2. A new file named `PersonMigration` is created.
3. A `MigrationStep` and `MigrationTask` are added to remove the "PlaceOfBirth" field from the documents of the `Person-document` model.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Data migration is disabled in the Project Template by default. In order to enable it, set `mgmtp.a12.dataservices.initialization.migration.enabled=true` in the `server/init/src/main/resources/config/application-shared.properties`. |

## Document Ownership

The document ownership concept defines the rules and permissions associated with creating, viewing and modifying the documents.
It involves two primary roles, **Admin** and **User**. Each role has specific privileges regarding document ownership, ensuring secure and controlled access to the created documents:

* **Admin** has full control over all documents.
* **User** has control only over the documents they created.

This approach provides a secure and organized environment, and this structure ensures data integrity and confidentiality within the application.

### Implementation

The document ownership is driven by the read and delete permissions in the `import/auth/childAuthorizationDefinition.json`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It’s essential to note that this document ownership approach is specifically tailored for the Project Template example Document Models.  It is crucial to adapt and handle document ownership on your own and based on the specific requirements of your application needs. If not, your application could be exploited by attackers. |

## End-to-End Testing

The Project Template uses Playwright as the testing framework for end-to-end (E2E) tests.

Our objective is to test a few core features of the template application. Please expand it with additional test suites to match your project’s scope.

The tests and related code are located in the `e2e` directory.

### Playwright

Playwright is a modern end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft that enables reliable testing across all modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). It provides an excellent experience for writing, debugging and running tests with its powerful API and built-in features like auto-wait, network interception, parallel test execution, screenshots, videos and trace viewer, etc.

Playwright also provides some powerful tools like:

* [Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)
* [Playwright inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector)
* [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)

If you are new to Playwright or are not familiar with it, you can learn more about it by reading its official documentation here [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### Prerequisites

To run the E2E tests, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* Your application is running/accessible. You can follow the instructions in the [Run](#_run) section.
* Go to `e2e` directory:

```
cd e2e
```

* Install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
npm run e2e:install
```

### File Structures

* **tests** contains all the test suites.
* **fixtures** contains all the test fixtures, mock data
* **pages** contains all the page object models (POMs). It helps to optimize ease of authoring and maintenance for your test suites.
* **types** contains all the data test IDs, some test data types.
* **utils** contains all the helper functions, e.g. files handling.

### Configuration Tests

You can update the `playwright.config.ts` file to point to the base path of your running application. In most cases you can leave it as the default `http://localhost:8081`.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests via the interactive UI mode:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm run e2e:test-ui ``` |
```

You can also run the tests in the terminal (default in headless mode)

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm run e2e:test ``` |
```

You can also use `cross-env` to set the BASE\_URL environment variable. This might be useful if you want to run the tests against a deployed version of the project in a CI context:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npx cross-env BASE_URL=<YOUR-DEPLOYED-APPLICATION-URL> npm run e2e:test ``` |
```

### Showing the HTML Report

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm run e2e:report ``` |
```

## Localization

The Project Template provides a built-in localization system that supports multiple languages and locales. It uses the [Utils Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/UTILS_LOCALIZATION/utils-localization-documentation-bundle/index.html) library to manage localization across the application.

### Default Locales

The Project Template includes translations for the following locales by default:

| **Language** | **Language Code** | **Country Code** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| English | en | US |
| German | de | DE |

Users can switch between locales at any time using the locale chooser dropdown in the application header. The selected locale is immediately applied to all UI text and date/time formatting.

### Default Translations

The Project Template includes pre-configured translations for both supported locales. These translations cover:

* Application labels: Header text, user information labels (e.g., "Logged in as"), and logout button
* Keycloak messages: Processing and error messages displayed during authentication
* Error messages: Security authorization errors, attachment validation errors, and content size errors
* A12 component translations: Translations from integrated A12 components are automatically included

### Localization Setup

Localization is configured in `client/src/appsetup.ts` as part of the composable application setup.
The `withLocalization` feature is applied via `combineFeatures`, and the localization settings are passed through `initialConfig`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` localization: {     supportedLocales,     translationSource: DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS,     getDateTimeResource } ``` |
```

* **`supportedLocales`**: The list of available locales with their display names (from `client/src/localization/index.ts`)
* **`translationSource`**: The `DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` map combining all locale resource files
* **`getDateTimeResource`**: A function returning the date-fns locale for date/time formatting based on the current language

### Localization Structure

The localization files are located in the `client/src/localization/` directory:

```
client/src/localization/
├── index.ts           # Main localization configuration
├── keys.ts            # Key structure definitions for custom labels
└── resources/
    ├── en_US.ts       # English translations
    └── de_DE.ts       # German translations
```

### Updating a Label

To override a default label from an A12 component, follow these steps. This example changes the attachment "replace" button label to "Override".

**Step 1:** Find the Key Path

Identify the correct key path from the component’s localization documentation.
Consult the [A12 Component Translations](#_a12_component_translations) section for links to each component’s localization documentation.

For this example, the Form Engine attachment button uses the key path `attachment.button.replace`.

**Step 2:** Add the key structure to `client/src/localization/keys.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` export const RESOURCE_KEYS = {     application: {         header: {             userinfo: {                 labels: {                     loggedInAs: "",                     logoutButton: ""                 }             }         },     },     // ... other keys     attachment: {         button: {             replace: ""         }     } }; ``` |
```

**Step 3:** Add the translation value in your locale files.

In `client/src/localization/resources/en_US.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export const en_US: LocalizationKeyTreeType = {     // ... other translations     attachment: {         button: {             replace: "Override"         }     } }; ``` |
```

In `client/src/localization/resources/de_DE.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export const de_DE: LocalizationKeyTreeType = {     // ... other translations     attachment: {         button: {             replace: "Überschreiben"         }     } }; ``` |
```

### Adding New Labels

To add new custom labels to the application, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Define the Key Structure

Add the new key to the `RESOURCE_KEYS` object in `client/src/localization/keys.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` export const RESOURCE_KEYS = {     application: {         header: {             userinfo: {                 labels: {                     loggedInAs: "",                     logoutButton: ""                 }             }         },         // Add your new keys here         myComponent: {             title: "",             description: ""         }     },     // ... other keys }; ``` |
```

**Step 2:** Add Translations

Add the translations for each supported locale.

In `client/src/localization/resources/en_US.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` export const en_US: LocalizationKeyTreeType = {     application: {         // ... existing translations         myComponent: {             title: "My Component",             description: "This is my new component"         }     },     // ... other translations }; ``` |
```

In `client/src/localization/resources/de_DE.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` export const de_DE: LocalizationKeyTreeType = {     application: {         // ... existing translations         myComponent: {             title: "Meine Komponente",             description: "Das ist meine neue Komponente"         }     },     // ... other translations }; ``` |
```

**Step 3:** Use the New Labels

Access the new labels in your components using the `useLocalizer` hook:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` import { useLocalizer, RESOURCE_KEYS } from "../../localization";  function MyComponent() {     const localizer = useLocalizer();      return (         <div>             {localizer(RESOURCE_KEYS.application.myComponent.title)}         </div>     ); } ``` |
```

### Adding a New Locale

To add support for a new locale (e.g., French), follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Create the Translation File

Create a new translation file in `client/src/localization/resources/`, for example `fr_FR.ts`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` import { LocalizationKeyTreeType } from "../keys";  export const fr_FR: LocalizationKeyTreeType = {     application: {         title: "Your-Project-Name",         header: {             userinfo: {                 labels: {                     loggedInAs: "Connecté en tant que",                     logoutButton: "Déconnexion"                 }             }         }     },     // ... other translations }; ``` |
```

**Step 2:** Register the Translation

Update `client/src/localization/index.ts` to include the new locale:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` import { de, enUS, fr, type Locale as DateLocale } from "date-fns/locale"; // ... other imports import { fr_FR } from "./resources/fr_FR";  export const DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS: LocalizationTreeMap = {     en: en_US,     de: de_DE,     // Add new locale     fr: fr_FR };  export const supportedLocales: LocalizedLocale[] = [     { language: "en", country: "US", name: { key: RESOURCE_KEYS.locale.en } },     { language: "de", country: "DE", name: { key: RESOURCE_KEYS.locale.de } },     // Add new locale     { language: "fr", country: "FR", name: { key: RESOURCE_KEYS.locale.fr } } ];  const DATE_LOCALES: Record<string, DateLocale> = { en: enUS, de, fr }; ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When adding a locale key like `RESOURCE_KEYS.locale.fr`, also add the corresponding entry to the `locale` object in `client/src/localization/keys.ts` and provide its translation in each locale resource file. |

### A12 Component Translations

The Project Template integrates translations from various A12 components. These resource keys are imported in `keys.ts` and their translations are automatically available when the locale is set.

To learn how to customize them, refer to their respective documentation:

* [Client Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/CLIENT/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#/advanced/localization)
* [Form Engine Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/FORM_ENGINE/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#localization)
* [Overview Engine Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/OVERVIEW_ENGINE/overviewengine-dev-docs/index.html#/overview-engine/localization)
* [Tree Engine Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/TREE_ENGINE/treeengine-dev-docs/index.html#localization)
* [Relationship Engine Localization](https://geta12.com/docs/RELATIONSHIP_ENGINE/relationshipengine-dev-docs/index.html#relationship-localization)

## Variants

Not only does the Project Template provide a plain starting point for new projects, but it is also packed with a number of out-of-the-box A12 functionalities and components.
In this chapter, we will introduce different variants of the Project Template and their main functionalities.

### Local Authentication

User Authentication and Authorization (UAA) simplifies and standardizes most common authentication types.
By default, the Project Template uses "OAUTH2" as a UAA authentication type. It uses OAUTH2 for authorization, OIDC for authentication and Keycloak as Identity Provider (IDP).
Nevertheless, providing a Project Template using the `LOCAL` mode benefits development purposes by significantly reducing setup time.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `LOCAL` authentication type is only intended for development, demonstration and training purposes. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of user management and use a different authentication type for production environments. |

#### Description

The `LOCAL` authentication type is used in the simple scenario where the application also acts as the IDP.
This means that while UAA provides a login endpoint, which verifies user credentials, the application is responsible for storing user data and validating users' passwords.

`LOCAL` is using the standard UAA JWT Token generation and processing.

If the authentication type is set to `LOCAL`, the application will load user data from a resource file. Therefore, we have configured additional settings to load the data in the application.

For more information about `LOCAL` authentication, please refer to the [UAA documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/UAA/uaa-documentation-src/index.html#local) on this topic.

#### Download

You can download this integration as an artifact [here](https://geta12.com/#/a12-artifact/npm/@com.mgmtp.a12.projecttemplate/project-template-local-auth/-/@com.mgmtp.a12.projecttemplate/project-template-local-auth-202506.5.1.tgz).

### Workflows

The Workflows component introduces an architecture in which Workflow management becomes an extension of Data Services.

#### Description

In this variant, we use the Workflows component, which integrates Business Process Model and Notion (BPMN) modeling capabilities into A12. BPMN enables graphical modeling of server-side workflows and their execution.
Documents may serve as input and output for a Workflow, and the UI for user tasks can be modeled using the existing A12 modeling approach.

A new module `workflows` including a Camunda service is added, which communicates with Data Services asynchronously.

Models that are involved in this integration are explained in the following subsections.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This variant requires certificates for modules communication. See the [Certificate Authentication](#_certificate_authentication) section for details. |

##### Document Models

* `OrderProcess_DM` is the Document Model containing the domain data for orders. It includes the `Task_DM`.
* `Task_DM` is used to display different processes of making an order.

##### Form Models

* `OrderProcess_FM` defines the UI for the `Enter Order details` task.
* `OrderConfirmation_FM` defines the UI for the `Confirm order` task.

##### Overview Models

* `OrderProcess_OM` links to the `OrderProcess_DM` Document Model that models data of its order and corresponding process.

##### BPMN

The Workflows component also requires a BPMN model along with Document Models and UI models.

* `OrderProcessWithoutInput.bpmn`:

  + Defines the business process.
  + Defines the expected input and output document of the process.
  + Defines the document name and Document Model name for the process.
  + Connects tasks to data and UI models.

![order process without input](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/project_template/project-template-documentation/assets/images/order-process-without-input.png)

* The circle with thin border in the top-left is the start node, the entry point into the process.
* First, the process reaches the user task "Enter order details", in which a customer enters their order (in our context in A12, this is done via a form).
* Once the customer completes the task, the two following steps will be handled:

  + The customer’s order detail will be canceled and reach the end.
  + The order details are sent to the next task "Confirm order". Here, the customer can approve the order.
* Then the process ends.

Please refer to the [Workflows documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/WORKFLOWS/dev-docs/index.html) to see more details.

### Notification Center

The Notification Center is an A12 component capable of supporting users by keeping track of the events occurring in the application. The purpose of the Notification Center is to manage A12 document-related tasks and events by multiple kinds of notifications presented to the users.

#### Description

This variant integrates the add-on provided by the Notification Center and the Data Distribution dependencies used by the Notification Center under the hood. This integration provides two features related to notification publishing:

* Display notifications to the user whenever a `Person` document is successfully created or deleted. For now, notifications are **only** displayed for the user, which triggered the events.
* `Reminder` is a new module that Notification Center provides. "Reminders" can be used by users
  to remind themselves or a group of users to work on certain tasks like application, appointments or any other kind of document.
  "Reminders" contain two different datetime fields. Whenever the time set in these fields is reached, a notification is created automatically and sent to the recipients specified in the "reminder" document.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This variant requires certificates for the communication between the modules. See the [Certificate Authentication](#_certificate_authentication) section for details. |

##### Document Models

* `A12Reminder_DM` is the Document Model provided by the Notification Center. It includes the data for the "reminder".

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Using `A12Reminder_DM` is mandatory. If you want to customize your "reminder" document, you must include this model and name it **A12Reminder**. Also, there must be a root group called **a12Reminder**. |

##### Form Models

* `A12Reminder_FM` defines the UI for displaying the `Reminder` task.

##### Overview Models

* `A12Reminder_OM` is a UI model that displays a list of data. It is built on the `A12Reminder_DM` model.

Please refer to the [Notification Center documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/NOTIFICATION_CENTER/notificationcenter-documentation/index.html) to see more details.
