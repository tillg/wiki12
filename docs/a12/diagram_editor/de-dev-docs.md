# Introduction

## Introduction

The Diagram Editor is a React and Redux-based framework for building interactive diagrams, where users can:

* Create, delete, move and manipulate nodes and edges
* Connect nodes with edges between ports on nodes
* Pan and zoom the canvas for navigation

Developers can:
\* customize the appearance of existing elements
\* extend the diagram by custom nodes, edges and ports
\* implement custom behavior for user interactions

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the required package:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install @com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor ``` |
```

Install the peer dependencies:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install @com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core @reduxjs/toolkit react styled-components ``` |
```

The Diagram Editor can be used in a pure React-Redux application as well as in an A12 Client Application. Please refer to the Redux Toolkit documentation to see how to integrate the components in a pure React-Redux application.

### Usage with A12 client

Load data

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` import { createDiagramState } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/renderer/store/slice";  // Loading the data via a data provider into an activity is just a suggestion. The main point is that the diagram state needs to be stored anywhere in the Redux state export const myDataProvider: DataProvider = {   name: "myDataProvider",   canHandle(config) {     return config.dataHolder.descriptor.x === "x"; // Depends on your activity   },   *provideData(config) {     const { activityId } = config;     if (config.operation === "load") {       yield* put(ActivityActions.setData({ activityId, data: createDiagramState() }));     }   } }; ``` |
```

Register the reducer

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` import { DiagramState } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/core/state"; import { createDiagramReducer } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/renderer/store/reducer";  function isMyDataHolder(dh: Activity.DataHolder): dh is Activity.DataHolder {   return dh.descriptor.x === "x"; // Depends on your activity }  const diagramReducer = createDiagramReducer();  // Connecting the diagram reducer with the activity data reducer of A12 Client export const myDataReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = {   reduce(dataHolders, action) {     const dataHolder = dataHolders.find(isMyDataHolder);     if (!dataHolder?.data || Object.keys(dataHolder.data).length === 0) {       return dataHolders; // alternatively create the initial diagram state here instead     }      const newData = diagramReducer(dataHolder.data as DiagramState, action);     return [{ ...dataHolder, data: newData }];   } }; ``` |
```

Create a View

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` import { View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/view"; import { A12DiagramWidget } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/a12Client/a12DiagramWidget"; import { DiagramState } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/core/state";   export function MyDiagramView(props: View) {   // The Diagram Widget expects a selector to where the data is stored. This enables you to store the data anywhere within the Redux state   const selectDiagramState = useCallback(     (state: object) => ActivitySelectors.data(props.activityId)(state) as DiagramState,     [props.activityId]   );    return <A12DiagramWidget activityId={props.activityId} selectDiagramState={selectDiagramState} />; } ``` |
```

Bring everything together in the A12 Client

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ``` | ``` const setup = ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({   ...restSetup,   dataHandlers: [myDataProvider],   dataReducers: [myDataReducer], });  export function MyApp() {   return (     <Provider store={setup.store}>       <OtherProviders>         <RegionUI           ...otherRegionProps,           viewProvider={viewProvider}         />       </OtherProviders>     </Provider>   ); }  function viewProvider(name: string) {   if (name === "MyDiagramView") {     return MyDiagramView;   }    return FrameFactories.viewProvider(name); } ``` |
```

## Diagram State

The Diagram State contains the diagram and additional UI state information.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` interface DiagramState {   diagram: Diagram;   ui: {     zoomLevel: number;     offset: { left: number; top: number };     selectedElements: Record<string, true>;     readonlyElements: Record<string, true>;     showGrid: boolean;     ...otherProps   }; } ``` |
```

### Diagram

The Diagram data structure contains **nodes** and **edges**. The key of the records is the id of the element.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` interface Diagram {   nodes: Record<string, DiagramNode>;   edges: Record<string, DiagramEdge>; } ``` |
```

Every DiagramElement has the property *customType* to allow developers to mark their custom elements. If the property is set, an own React Component must be registered as well.

Each Node can have multiple **Ports**, on which edges can be attached to. They are only visible if the node is hovered or focussed.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` interface DiagramNode extends DiagramElement {   id: string;   type: "node";   label: string;   ports: PortMap;   x: number;   y: number;   width: number;   height: number;   customType: "myNodeType" } ``` |
```

Each **middle point** of a Port is positioned relative to the **top left corner** of its parent node.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export interface DiagramPort extends DiagramElement {   id: string;   type: typeof DEFAULT_PORT_TYPE;   width: number;   height: number;   offset: { left: number; top: number; };   customType: "myPortType" } ``` |
```

Each Edge consists of *at least* two **Anchors**, which are the points that describe an edge route. The default edge is orthogonal.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` export interface DiagramEdge extends DiagramElement {   id: string;   type: "edge";   anchors: { id: string; x: number; y: number }[];   sourceNodeId: string;   sourcePortId: string;   targetNodeId: string;   targetPortId: string;   customType: "myEdgeType" } ``` |
```

## Event Flow

The event flow in the diagram editor is designed to be unidirectional, following a straight path from user interactions to state updates. Here’s a high-level overview of the event flow:

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the diagram (e.g., dragging a node, connecting ports).
2. **Event Dispatching**: These interactions are dispatched as Redux actions via the action creators of **a12DiagramActions**.
3. **Enablement**: It is checked if the current action is allowed based on the ui state and/or the enablement rules defined in the diagramReducer. If the action is denied and a backup exists, the backup will be restored.
4. **State Update**: If the action is enabled, the corresponding reducers process these actions and update the diagram state in the Redux store.

## Recipes

### Modifying the Diagram State

Modifying the Diagram State should be done by dispatching actions from **a12DiagramActions**. For more complex or project related scenarios, you can also create custom actions and reducers to handle specific state changes.

The recommended way to create a custom reducer is to pass it into the **createDiagramReducer** function. Since the diagram state can be changed in an arbitrary way, you need to be careful here what is updated. E.g. if a node is dragged and your custom reducer deletes said node, an exception **will** occur. This way we offer maximum flexibility at the cost of the developer experience.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` import { defaultDiagramReducer } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/renderer/store/slice";  function myCustomReducer(state: DiagramState, action: Action): DiagramState {   if (a12DiagramActions.nodeAdded.match(action)) {     const additionalNode = createNode();     const updatedState = defaultDiagramReducer(state, action); // let the default reducer process the action first     // add an additional node every time a node is added     return {       ...updatedState,       diagram: {         ...updatedState.diagram,         nodes: {           ...updatedState.diagram.nodes,           [additionalNode.id]: additionalNode         }     };   }    return defaultDiagramReducer(state, action); }  const diagramReducer = createDiagramReducer({ customReducer: myCustomReducer }); ``` |
```

### Adding Custom Elements

To add custom elements to the diagram, you need to use the customType property in the Diagram Data Structure and register a React component in the A12DiagramWidget.

The following example showcases how to register a custom node. The same pattern can be used for edges, ports and dialogs (explained in the next section).

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ``` | ``` interface MyNode extends DiagramNode {   customType: "myNode";   customProperty: any; }  // Nodes are positioned automatically function MyNodeWidget(props: NodeWidgetProps) {   const { node } = props   return <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightblue', height: node.height, width: node.width }} />; }  const myNode: MyNode = { id: "1", type: "node", customType: "myNode", customProperty: "someValue", ...restNode }; const customDiagramData: Diagram = { nodes: { [myNode.id]: myNode }, edges: {} };  function selectDiagramState() {   return createDiagramState(uiState, customDiagramData) }  function CustomDiagram() {   return <A12DiagramWidget     activityId={props.activityId}     selectDiagramState={selectDiagramState}     nodeWidgetMap={{ myNode: MyNodeWidget }}     // below are not implemented in this example     edgeWidgetMap={{ myEdge: MyEdgeWidget }}     portWidgetMap={{ myPort: MyPortWidget }}     dialogWidgetMap={{ myDialog: MyDialogWidget }}   />; } ``` |
```

### Disabling events / Showing dialogs

Per default the user is allowed to interact with the diagram without restrictions. The **enablements** customization point of the diagramReducer allows disabling specific events or requesting dialogs that the user needs to confirm. Dialogs are not restricted to confirmation alone. You could also implement e.g. a form, to request additional data, before an edge is connected to a node. The default dialog that we offer is a confirmation dialog that always contains a cancel and confirm button, which can be modified. For everything else you need to add a custom dialog.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` const customEnablements: DiagramEnablementMap = {   canMoveNode: (node, vector, state) => {     if (node.id === "x") {       return false; // Prevent moving this specific node     } else {       return true;     }   },   canRemoveElements: (elements, state) => {     // return a dialog object to let the user confirm the removal     return {       dialog: {         title: "Remove Elements",         message: "Are you sure you want to remove the selected elements?",         type: "dialog",         severity: "warning",         confirmButton: { label: "Remove", primary: true, destructive: true },         cancelButton: { label: "Cancel", primary: false, destructive: false }     }   } }  const diagramReducer = createDiagramReducer({ enablements: customEnablements }); ``` |
```

### Hiding continuous actions from Redux Devtools

Since we have implemented everything with redux actions, the devtools will be crowded by dragging actions (e.g. panning the canvas, moving nodes). We have collected these actions in **diagramBlacklistedActions**, which can be hidden by the devtools.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` import { devToolsEnhancer } from "@redux-devtools/extension"; import { diagramBlacklistedActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.diagrameditor/diagrameditor/dist/reduxDevTools/blacklistedActions";  return ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({   ...setup,   composeEnhancer(enhancers) {     return compose(enhancers, devToolsEnhancer({ actionsDenylist: diagramBlacklistedActions }));   } }); ``` |
```

```
