# A12 Client

## Introduction

With the Client we pursuit a model-driven solution for building the client-side of business applications.

![frame](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/overview/frame.png)

The Client uses the same model based approach like the Engines, i.e., an **Application Model** along with an interpreter that describes the UI structure and the user interaction behavior of the client application. Therefore, the model introduces high-level concepts that are independent of the underlying Client technologies.

It can also be seen as an orchestrator for the Engines and Widgets. The A12 team **hides a lot of complexity within the Engines** and the Services (like validation/computation), so that the Client runtime can be focused and lean.

![building-blocks](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/overview/building-blocks.png)

Further features for the Client are:

* Support for desktop and mobile devices out of the box. Note that while Plasma is not mobile-first, it ensures usability and consistency across device classes.
* Flexible UI frame according to guidelines by A12 UI/UX team. Client has the concept of frame regions (in which views live) that improve upon the rigid three-pane layout of former UX approaches.
* Extensible by various mechanisms like factories and inversion of control.
* Modern and lean technology stack: just TypeScript, React, Redux, Redux-Saga as well as Engines, Widgets, and Services.

### Technologies

Client is a front-end platform based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) libraries, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and built via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

![stack-with-react](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/redux/stack-with-react.svg)

The Client architecture invests fully in the React ecosystem. We have chosen the following technologies:

* **TypeScript**: It’s static typed (but weak typed) with features that allow for truly scalable (code-wise) application development. Although React and Redux are JavaScript, we use the available TypeScript typings, so it becomes even safer to use these libraries.
* **React**: efficient rendering of the UI component tree ("virtual DOM") without caring about current DOM state, i.e., no data binding required. React is also at the core of the Engines and Widgets.
* We have applied best practices like functional rendering, separation of container and presentational components, and extensions through wrapping with higher order components (HOCs).
* **Redux**: easy-to-understand unidirectional data flow. It follows heavily the functional paradigm instead of object-orientated. Redux enables the [Immutable App Architecture](https://medium.com/react-weekly/embracing-immutable-architecture-dc04e3f08543), which is the core of the Client architecture.
* **Sagas**: make complex asynchronous control flows look like synchronous code. Sagas are elegant for any kind of background work that you would put into threads in Java.

Please understand the Redux concepts like store, state, reducer, middleware, action, action creator; and also how connecting React components works via provider and the `connect` functions of the "react-redux" library.

![redux-unidir-ui-arch](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/redux/redux-unidir-ui-arch.jpg)

Figure 1. [Source](https://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html)

Sagas are, like middleware and specially [thunks](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk), a way to introduce impure effects into the pure functional world of Redux, like asynchronous I/O. However, unlike thunks, sagas express these asynchronous steps in conventional sequential manner (by utilizing JavaScript generators combined with async and await).

With Redux-Saga, the situation changes slightly:

![redux-saga](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/redux/redux-saga.jpg)

Figure 2. [Source](https://staltz.com/)

Sagas are background generator functions that typically are triggered by incoming actions and then start off complex steps.

Note that the `take` effect (and any variants), that waits for an action in a saga, returns **only after the store changes happened** and all middlewares and reducers are already executed for a specific action. Meaning that a saga can only react but not change or discard actions (unlike middleware).

### Principles

The following diagram shows the principal structuring of the Client into modules and their responsibilities in the architecture.

![key-concepts](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/overview/key-concepts.svg)

The Client modules fall in one of these categories:

* State Management
* Application Model
* Store
* Supporting Sagas
* Data I/O
* Data Hub with the DataLoaders/DataEditors
* DataProvider Principles
* Presentation
* Abstract UI Structures
* Views
* Business Logic

### Packages

The public API of the client library is provided via the following npm packages:

* @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core: Provides the core functionality of the client library
* @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-application-model-migration: Provides the application model migration tool
* @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-data: An experimental data access library for client-side components. This package is not yet stable and may be moved, renamed or removed without deprecation in future releases. Use with caution.

## Getting Started

This chapter gives a quick guide to start developing you own application with the Client.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the Client library no special software dependencies are necessary.

#### Useful Tools

##### A12 Modeling Tools

The A12 SME offers the opportunity to create document and UI models. It provides a way to upload models to the server. Be aware that the A12 modeling tools version has to fit to the version of the backend (i.e. Services and Engines).

Please check the [A12 Releases](https://geta12.com/#/releases/releases-overview) page to find out about compatible versions of different A12 components.

##### React and Redux Developer Tools

The React and Redux extensions are essential to inspect your application’s UI and backend state.

## Basic Concepts

This chapter gives an introduction to the basic concepts of the A12 Client.

### Application Frame

#### Elements of the Application Frame

The A12 UI/UX team has defined a specific structure for the Plasma design that is called application frame. It consists of four distinguished elements:

* **Application Header**: contains e.g. logo, selected locale, user, and role information
* **Navigation**: shows the main menu
* **Context (Sidebar)**: displays additional information, context-related actions, and allows for sub navigation
* **Content**: shows for example the Engines in specific layouts, e.g., a master-detail layout.

![Elements of the Application Frame](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/application-frame.png)

### Views

#### Arranging UIs

The Application Model is an A12 UI Model for defining the “macroscopic” UI aspects of applications based on [Plasma for Business Applications](https://geta12.com/docs/PLASMA/plasma-concept-documentation/index.html). This includes

* main menu
* regions
* views

Inner parts of the UI can also be created using A12, but this is done using other A12 components, e.g. Engines based on Form and Overview Model.

Each Application Model consists of *Modules*. A Module is a high level building block of the application and directly accessible via the main menu. It consists mainly of:

* (optional) menu entry
* flows with scenes

Menu defines the main menu entry of the Module and which Activity is started when it is selected.

The scenes define the actual functionality of the Module. Each scene consists of

* match conditions
* enter and leave directives
* cases

##### Match Conditions

Match conditions define when the scene applies. They always refer to the [Activity Descriptor](#/basics/activity/activity-descriptor). The Application Model supports the following matching strategies:

* **mustEqual:** a property must equal a (constant) value
* **isSet:** a property must be set

##### Directives

If the scene applies, the respective scene is “entered” and the enter directives are executed. If the scene no longer applies, the respective “leave” directives are executed.

The available directives are

* *VIEW\_ADD*
* *REGION\_CLEAR*

The VIEW\_ADD directive has the following parameters:

* **Region:** Defines to which Region the view should be added. If no region is defined, the `defaultRegion` property of the Application Model is used.
* **Name:** Defines the name of the React/Redux UI component that is responsible for visualizing the view.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In addition, make sure that the UI component is provided by the *View Factory* configured in the application setup. |

* **Constraints:** Contains configurable constraints for the current layout. There are the following pre-defined properties:

  + `type`: refers to the layout to be configured. Some properties can only be specified for certain types. Currently the only built-in type is "MasterDetail"
  + `preferredWidth`: only available for type "MasterDetail". Determines the preferred width of the rightmost view. If another view is visible on the left hand side, this other view will take up the remaining space. Note that this property is only evaluated for "detail" views, because when having just a single view (the "master"), it will always take up the full width.
* **Configuration:** Contains configurable constraints for the current view.
* **models:** an optional array of model descriptor objects. Each of them describes an A12 model to be loaded. Whenever this array is defined, the runtime automatically triggers model and data loading for this scene
* **loadData:** an optional boolean flag. When set to true, the runtime automatically triggers data loading for this scene. This flag is only required, if you want to load data without having any A12 models.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Setting `loadData` to false will not prevent data loading, if there are models defined for the current view (see [Data Loading](#/basics/data-loading)). However you can prevent data loading by  * not defining models and setting loadData to false/undefined * manually setting the loadingState of the activity to "without" |

The REGION\_CLEAR directive has the following parameters:

* **Region:** Defines which Region should be cleared. If no region is defined, the `defaultRegion` property of the Application Model is used.
* **Layout:** Sets the layout for the Region. If no layout is defined, the layout from its region is used.

##### Regions

Regions are visual locations inside the page. Currently, there are three regions available:
*CONTENT*, *SIDEBAR* and *MODAL*.

* Views placed in *CONTENT* will appear in the content area of the application frame widget.
* Views placed in *SIDEBAR* will appear in the sidebar of the application frame widget.
* Views placed in *MODAL* will appear in a modal dialog.

##### Cases

*Cases* are an advanced feature to switch between different UIs without changing Activities.

#### Views are Identifiable Content Parts

The A12 UI UX team has analyzed several layouts and UI flows from existing projects. Below are shown the most common ones.

##### Master/Detail

The most simple is the master/detail layout. Here’s an illustration:

![concept1-master-detail](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/concept1-master-detail.png)

The master is here denoted as "View A" and is typically a data-browser, i.e., a list of business objects in rows. A12 calls this an "**overview**". The controls for filtering, sorting and search criteria are here part of View A for simplicity, but search criteria can also be a view on its own. Also note the sidebar with optional information about the overview. By selecting a row you open and edit the details of the corresponding business object, here represented as "View A.B". For example, this is a form with all attributes as fields and input controls.

This example uses two content parts, which we will denote "**views**": the overview in a first view, the detail view in a second view. Now let’s see some more challenging examples.

##### Nested Details

The role of being a master and a detail is not fixed, meaning that a detail can become master and open a new, nested detail. In the following example:

1. The overview in "View A" is a master, shown fully maximized.
2. Selecting a row in the overview brings up the details of the respective business object in "View A.B".

   * Using tabs in the detail view, the information of the business object can be broken down into multiple forms, here "View A.B" (the default view of the business object) and "View A.C". For example let’s say that the business object is an insurance policy and "View A.B" is the general data and "View A.C" is the list of terms&conditions, which is shown again as an overview.
3. Selecting a row in "View A.C" which is a list of terms&conditions as an overview, brings up the details of the corresponding term&condition item in "View A.C.D" as a form. Please note that the term&condition item is seen here as nested (or contained) business object of the policy. Thinking this way, we can apply our concepts in a recursive manner.

![concept2-tabs](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/concept2-tabs.png)

###### View Assignment

Let’s break this down into an assignment of views:

* Overview "View A" is assigned the view #1.
* "View A.B" and "View A.C" are different "details" of the selected business object, here a policy with the details "general data" (B) and "terms&conditions" (C). Both render their content into a view. Note that switching tabs to change between "View A.B" and "View A.C" does change the view assignment and layout.
* "View A.C.D" is the detail of the selected term&condition item and is assigned a new view.

###### Layout

Now let’s specify the layout with a focus on visibility: For a desktop, the content area can only show up to two views. That means for our example:

* view #1 appears maximized if alone.
* If view #2 appears, view #1 for the overview moves to the left and shrinks.
* If view #3 appears, view #2 moves to the left and view #1 is hidden and effectively disappears.

![md-layout-for-views](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/md-layout-for-views.png)

The layout rules can be dependent on device class and available screen space. For example, a smart phone might only show the latest view, or render views from top to bottom.

![layouts-variations](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/layouts-motivation.png)

###### Summary

In summary, these points are important:

* Activities open up one (or even multiple) views
* A view can use tabs internally in order to show different aspects about the business object respective the activity. Another option is to use views and switch between them, as discussed in the subsection below.
* Layout rules can organize views on screen, like maximizing, minimizing, proportions, max shown views, etc.

##### Changing Context in the Sidebar Region

Usually, each activity is tied to something like a result list (overview) or a business object. Each view of an activity can have its own context information in the sidebar. For an insurance policy this e.g. is the title, insured sum and other key data, but also an action panel with buttons for printing, progressing the workflow state, etc., is useful.

Until now we have assigned views to the content region only. But the sidebar region can also contain views. In general, regions contain views, and the application frame has two standard regions: the content and sidebar areas.

![concept3-cosmo](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views/concept3-cosmo.png)

If we break this down, we can assign views for the example above to the **sidebar** as follows:

* "View A" has no sidebar content, thus the sidebar is hidden.
* For "View A.B" has specific sidebar content, for example "policy info" in "Info" which is assigned view #S1 and an action panel "B" which is assigned view #S2a.
* For "View A.C" (which is another view of the same activity as "View A.B"), the sidebar continues to show "Info" in view #S1, removes any other view in the sidebar and adds a new view #S2b for the action panel "C" for terms & conditions.
* For "View A.D" (again another view of the same activity as "View A.B" and "View A.C"), the sidebar again continues to show view #S1, but again removes any other view in the sidebar and adds a new view #S2c for the action panel "E" for coverage.

###### Thinking in View Directives

You might wonder why we focus on the sequence of delta changes when navigating between the views and not just specify how each view should look. The reason is that activities and view navigation actually express these delta changes by using **directives**: "VIEW\_ADD" (add view named X to region Y) and "REGION\_CLEAR" (clear region Y, i.e., remove all previously assigned views). We will learn much more about this in the section about the Application Model.

###### Summary

In summary, these points are important:

* The application frame has two regions that contain views: content area and sidebar. Others are possible, but must be added explicitly by the projects.
* Views can be assigned and removed to achieve view-dependent dynamic content in the regions.

#### Example: Design Study

We now want to apply the ideas to a example.

As can be seen below, the application frame shows a menu in the header. Clicking on the menu entry opens the overview. This action technically does the following:

* Starts a new overview activity.
* Allocates a view in the content region.
* Renders an Overview Engine with a result list of selectable objects.

![step1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views-example/step1.png)

Selecting a specific row opens up the details about the corresponding entry. From the technically perspective, this again starts a new activity for editing the objects and changes the regions like this:

* Three views are assigned to the sidebar: an information panel, an action panel, and a view selection menu.
* One view in the content area with a Form Engine.

##### Clearing a Region

Note that the Form Engine view is shown maximized even though an overview view exists. The view assignment for the activity specified in the Application Model causes all regions to be *cleared*. If a previous activity has assigned views to a certain region, these views are ignored by the layout manager if the region is cleared on behalf of the current/active activity.

![step2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views-example/step2.png)

The screenshot below illustrates the next user interaction, where the user switches between cases which results in a change in layout:

* The first view is *removed* and replaced by a new view which in this case is an overview.
* Note that the sidebar stays the same.

The overview shows another list and can be seen as a "master". A click in a row brings up the details for the selected item (see the blue arrow on the right side of the illustration below). This starts a new, nested activity.

![step3](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views-example/step3.png)

The next screenshot shows the result of this activity:

* The view for the overview is *kept*.
* A new view in the content area region is allocated and shows another overview.
* The sidebar stays the same.

![step4](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views-example/step4.png)

### Activity

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of "activities" in a somewhat vague way. Activities are a very important client-side Concept and are actually quite well specified.

An activity can be seen as a bracket around user interactions, another term for this bracket is "use case" (taken from requirement engineering).
Typical use cases are:

* Overview: showing a list of business objects as a result of a search. Typical user interactions are: scrolling/paging, sorting, filtering, refining search criteria.
* Editing a business object like using a form.

The Client has special support for these typical use cases, but any user interactions can be managed as an activity. The DevApp shows a variety of activities.

In order to drive the use case, an activity holds all the relevant data and state, and provides the UI component (indirectly though) for interacting with the data.

#### Activity Data Structure

* [Activity Descriptor](#/basics/activity/activity-descriptor)
* [Properties](#/basics/activity/properties)
* [Operations on Activities](#/basics/activity/operations-on-activities)
* [Data Loading](#/basics/activity/data-loading)
* [Linking Activities](#/basics/activity/linking-activities)

Technically, an activity is a data structure in the Redux store that holds all information of what the runtime and the application UI component need to know about this use case instance.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` export interface Activity {   readonly id: string;   readonly descriptor: ActivityDescriptor;   readonly initiatingActivityId?: string;   // ... }  export interface ActivityDescriptor {   readonly instance?: string; // e.g. „P2“   readonly [key: string]: string | undefined; } ``` |
```

##### Activity Descriptor

The Activity Descriptor is a key/value-map that specifies what the activity is doing, e.g., the type of use case and details like the ID of the business object.

The idea is to separate the intention, i.e., *"What should be done"* from the interpretation and implementation of *"How should it be done"*. The *"what"* is the Activity Descriptor and it is the responsibility of the activity creator to specify it. The *"how"* is specified by "use case matches" in the [Application Model](#/basics/application-model).

###### Pre-defined Key

There is one key with a pre-defined meaning: The instance key specifies the ID of the business object, or in A12 context, the A12 data document ID. For creating a new document the constant `NEW_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` (`"__NEW__"`) from `core/application` should be used.

It is pre-defined in the sense that the provides I/O (loading/saving) and UI components that interpret this key in the following way: if a Form Model has been specified in the matching scene and the instance is set in the descriptor, e.g., `{ "instance": "P222" }`, this is interpreted as the use case "Editing data in a form": load the document for the specified business object and bring up a form. This uses the Document Model which is referenced in the specified Form Model.

##### Properties

Let’s break down the most important properties.

* `id`: each activity needs a unique identifier. The identifier also allows "weak" references to the activity, i.e., without using object references, which are problematic w.r.t. the "immutable state" principle of Redux. You are responsible for assigning unique ids to activities. If you
  want to cancel and recreate an activity, a new id must be set to differentiate it from previous activities.
* `initiatingActivityId` and `sourceActivityId`: see [details below](#/basics/activity/linking-activities).
* `case`: this relates to the UI and scenes. See [Cases](#/basics/application-model/cases) for details.
* `dataHolders`: each activity has a list of DataHolder objects. Each of them is responsible for one data source and has its own data descriptor see [details below](#/basics/activity/data-holder).

##### DataHolder

A DataHolder is responsible for the data of one data source within an activity.
It consists of a `descriptor` to specify what kind of data is being stored as well as other properties to keep track of the data. The Activity Descriptor is then only relevant for determining a matching scene from the Application Model.

When an activity is created, it is initialized with one default DataHolder, which gets the activity’s descriptor as its DataHolder descriptor. More DataHolders can be added to the activity later.

The `error` property of the DataHolder is intended for tracking `"loading"` or `"saving"` errors. For tracking other errors it is recommended to store them inside the `slices` property of the DataHolder. This can be easily achieved by creating a custom action and a custom DataReducers.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A technical action (like "setData") to set arbitrary data of a DataHolder is not recommended, because actions should be named from a business perspective. See the [Data Loading](#/basics/activity/data-loading) section below for alternatives. |

All properties of the DataHolder are described in more details in the API reference.

###### Example

Here is an example of an activity that has a list with three DataHolders. There is one DataHolder storing the document data of the activity, and two other DataHolders storing link and candidate relationship data.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ``` | ``` const activity = {     id: "223",     descriptor: {         model: "Product",         instance: "DomainProduct/15"     },     dataHolders: [         {             descriptor: { model: "Product", instance: "DomainProduct/15"},             data: {},             dirty: "false",             loadingState: "missing",             savingState: "not_saved"         },         {             descriptor: { type: "candidate", instance: "1" },             data: { /*...*/ },             dirty: "false",             loadingState: "loaded",             savingState: "not_saved"         },         {             descriptor: { type: "link", instance: "1" },             data: { /*...*/ },             dirty: "false",             loadingState: "loaded",             savingState: "not_saved"         }     ] }; ``` |
```

##### Operations on Activities

###### Creating an Activity

There are some pre-defined Redux action factories for working with activities.

Use the `create` function to create the Redux action `PUSH` that creates (or "pushes") a new activity:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` function create({ activityId, activityDescriptor, initiatingActivityId, data, loadingState, slices }: CreatePayload): Action<PushPayload> { /*...*/ }; ``` |
```

Make sure that activityId uniquely identifies an activity across the lifetime of the user session. Failure to do so might result in unintended behavior (e.g. skipping of model loading). If you
want to cancel and recreate an activity, a new id must be set to differentiate it from previous activities.

If you want to create a new activity with data already in place, the recommended way would be to hand in this data via the optional data property of the params object.

If you still want to update the data of the activity directly after the creation, e.g. dispatching the `ActivityActions.setData` action directly afterwards, you need to wait with the dispatch, until the data and models resulting from dispatching `create` are present in the store. Otherwise, the data you want to set with setData would be overwritten! This is due to the asynchronous model and data loading, that happens after dispatching `create`.

##### Data Loading

Most activity types require data and also models, e.g., an overview has the list of search results and the Overview Model; the Form Engine requires the document data for the business object and also the document and UI models. This information is kept in the `data` property, which has an internal structure depending on the activity type.

When an activity is created, like in the examples above, all that is required is the Activity Descriptor. Passing data is optional. Typically loading data and models is and should be delegated to the runtime, specifically to the DataHandlers.[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]

The property `loadingState` tracks the progress and gives information about the outcome:

* `"without"`: the activity does not require any data, and the `data` property is `undefined`.
* `"missing"`: the activity requires data and possibly models. The runtime has to load them. Until they are loaded, the `data` property is `undefined`.
* `"loading"`: the runtime is currently loading data and models.
* `"loaded"`: the loading of data and models was successful.
* `"error"`: there was at least one error during the loading of data and models. This information is optional.

An additional property `savingState` is a complementary tracking state for saving data.

##### Linking Activities

###### The Initiating Activity

This is where nesting of activities comes into play. As we saw in the previous examples, activities can be easily created, like a selection in an overview master creates a form detail activity. Creating an activity is always relative to a **parent activity** (called the "initiating activity") with a reference by ID as `initiatingActivityId`. Note that the very first activity has no parent, so the ID is not set (`undefined`).

Linking activities this way creates a tree which is utilized in the Client:

* Canceling an activity will cancel all linked sub-activities.
* Committing an activity will commit all linked sub-activities.

![activity-dependencies](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/activities/activity-dependencies.svg)

###### The Source Activity

There is a second kind of link between activities that is concerned with where the data comes from. Data can come from an existing activity or from somewhere else (subject to the selected DataLoader), typically a server side data service.[[2](#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")]

An existing activity is either the direct parent of the activity or any parent above this parent. The id is kept in the `datasourceActivityId` property. If data comes from somewhere else, this property is not set (`undefined`).

Consider the example that is illustrated above.

#### Work with Business Data

Every task that the user is working on is represented as an *activity*. An activity resembles a (possibly long-running) interaction of the user with the system, e.g. filling out a (possibly large) form, browsing data, reading a message, etc.

The main properties of an activity are

* descriptor
* data and loading state
* initiating and source activity

##### Activity Descriptor

The *Activity Descriptor* is an outline of the activity. It declares what the activity is about. Most activities will deal with business data. Because of this, the notion of a business object is built into the descriptor. Therefore, it is possible to define an arbitrary number of *string* properties to describe the activity. These can augment the business data or be used in activities that do not deal with business objects.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Currently, only the property "instance" is reserved for A12 own use. |

##### Activity Data

Of course, activities can also contain the actual data of the business object. Data that comes from one data source is typically kept in one DataHolder. The data can be of any structure, however in most cases it should be an *A12 Document*. The loading state is also held as a separate property within this DataHolder.

In addition to the actual data, there are several properties providing additional information about the activity’s data:

* **loading and saving state:** tells whether the activity DataHolder contains data at all and if yes, if the data is missing, loaded or the loading failed. These are usually controlled and used by DataHandlers and related functionality.
* **lock:** can be used by business logic to prevent any changes to the DataHolder - a locked DataHolder is also considered as "dirty" - see the dirty handling feature (see below)
* **dirty information:** can be used by business logic to prevent an accidental cancellation of the activity.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | The feature only works if the "cancel requested" event action is used instead of the "cancel" command action. |
* **error state:** Holds information about a `"loading"` or `"saving"` error that is currently present. The error has always an `errorCode` that defines the type of error and - depending on the type - additional, type specific information.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you create A12 documents by yourself, you need to make sure that they fulfill the interface of `Activity.Data.Document`. Next to your data your document needs to contain an `id` and a `modelId`. For new documents you can use the constant `NEW_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` as the document id. |

##### Activity Relations

If an activity has been started by another activity, then that activity is available as *initiating* activity. If an activity obtained its data from another activity, then that activity is available as (data) *source* activity.

##### DataReducers

The business data held in an activity can be changed by the user working on a task like filling out a form or by a system executing a technical task.
To achieve this, the Client provides the concept of [DataReducers](#/basics/data-reducers) which give fine-grained control over changes to the business data within DataHolders.

As an example, the UI state of the Form Engine is handled by a DataReducer.

### From Activities to Views to Engines

Let’s bring together the concepts we saw so far — views, activities, and also Engines — and show how they play together to present the UI. We stick to our insurance policy example (here labelled "offer").

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | For simplicity reasons we will focus only on the default application frame layout. The behavior for custom layouts depends mainly on the the region and layout implementation. |

When the application starts and no menu item is selected, the application frame is empty or shows the default content for the sidebar and content.

![step1](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/activities-animation/step1.svg)

#### Creating the First Activity (Overview)

In the next step the user clicks on the menu item "Offer" and activity 1 is created with the Activity Descriptor “{ "model": "offer"}”:

We will study the Application Model only in the next section, but note that this action is declared in the model.

As a result of creating this activity, scene directives are executed according to the Application Model. In this case: first clear the sidebar and the content regions, then add a view for showing the Overview Engine.

![step2](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/activities-animation/step2.svg)

Note that until now the activity is only containing the Activity Descriptor but no data or models, which is also indicated by the loading state `"loading"`. As a consequence, the view cannot render much, maybe an animation to indicate this pending state, but not the Overview Engine. Loading of data and models is done through DataHandlers and orchestrated by the Client runtime.

The next step begins when the data and models are loaded and the loading state is changed to `"loaded"`. Now the view has all required parameters for the Overview Engine and can instantiate and render it inside the view.

![step3](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/activities-animation/step3.svg)

#### Creating the Second Activity (Detail)

The user now interacts with the overview and clicks on a row in order to edit the details of the offer. Here’s what happens. The view issues a Redux action to create a second activity. This activity has the first activity as the initiating activity; but not as source activity, since it will get the offer document data from the server.

As a result of creating this new activity, directives are executed according to the Application Model. In this case:

* clear the sidebar region (but not the content region),
* then add a view in the sidebar for the info panel
* and another view in the content region for showing the Form Engine

Note again that until now the activity is only containing the Activity Descriptor but no data or models. As with the first activity, data and models are loaded and the loading state is updated accordingly.

As soon as the views have all required parameters, the view contents are updated with the actual information (sidebar) and Form Engine (content region).

![step4](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/activities-animation/step4.svg)

#### Changing the Selected Row in the Overview

A typical user interaction in this master/detail situation is the selection of another row in the master, i.e., overview. One would expect the following to happen in the UI: the form on the right is cancelled (possibly by asking the user for permission if the form has changed data) and the form content is replaced with the document data of the newly selected row. This breaks down into an action sequence and view changes like this:

1. We start with just the activity 1 and showing the overview and the user selects a row in the overview.
2. Just [like before](#/basics/activities-views-engines/creating-first-activity) the overview view dispatches an action (`create`) in order to create a dependent activity 2.
3. Now the user selects another row in the overview.
4. It needs to be checked if there exists a child activity of the overview activity.

   * If no child activity exists, a (`create`) action can be dispatched in order to create a new dependent activity.
   * If a child activity exists, this child activity needs to be cancelled by dispatching the (`cancelRequested`) action. It is possible to provide an activity to the (`cancelRequested`) action that replaces the canceled activity in order to avoid dispatching an additional (`create`) action after the cancellation.

### Application Model

So far we have focused on the runtime and understand how starting activities creates views in regions that show the UI elements. One piece of the puzzle is missing so far: how exactly do you specify which and how many views are associated with an activity? This section will explain that this association is in the Application Model, specifically in the "scene" descriptions.

#### Overview

The Application Model is all about the structure of the UI in terms of regions and layout, and behavior – when and how UI components should be placed in the UI. The building blocks of the model are summarized in this diagram:

![model-hierarchy](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/model-hierarchy.svg)

Let’s go quickly through these elements:

##### Application

* Header specifies generic model properties like id, supported locales, annotations etc.
* Specifies the modules
* Regions configuration specifies the application frame and layouts.

##### Module

* Functional domain of an application
* Represented as "Main menu entry", that triggers the creation of the flow’s initial activity.

##### Flow

* UI interaction bracket, i.e. it divides the user interaction into discrete parts. Think of it as a *micro-workflow* on the client side.
* In this sense, it is also a closure for a set of connected UI configurations; specifically it breaks down into multiple steps in the flow that we denote *scenes*.

##### Scene

UIs in the Client are modeled using "Scenes", where a scene is "entered" when some configurable conditions are met. When a scene is entered, its specified scene change (which in turn contains scene directives) is executed. This, in turn, reconfigures the UI.

* Single UI configuration
* triggered by a change in the activities and activated by an Activity Descriptor match
* linked to a (required) prior scene (except initial scenes of a flow)
* AD match always includes the prior scene implicitly

##### Case

* Sub-case of an UI arrangement
* triggered by an explicit case change (manually) / activated by a case menu entry
* hence, all cases within a scene operate on the same activity!

##### Scene Change

* Contains directives that should be executed when the scene/case changes
* onEnter: When the scene/case is entered
* onExit: When the scene is followed by a next one (see [below](#/basics/application-model/scene-changes))

Here’s an example and break-down the UI and its changes in terms of flows, scenes and scene changes:

![flow-illustration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/flow-illustration.svg)

#### Configuration of Regions

We have seen how applications can place contents of UI components in *regions*, like the content, sidebar and modal region. However, the Application Model allows arbitrarily named and even nested regions.

* In the Application Model, regions can have any name and there are no "predefined" regions . The semantics of the regions are defined by the layout that is assigned to the region.
* The tree of regions is defined (statically) in the Application Model.
* There is one top-level region - the application (or "app") region. If it has the `ApplicationFrame` layout then it resembles the classical application frame with the content and sidebar regions.

Here’s the excerpt from the model that sets up the three regions of the previous examples:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` { 	"region": { 		"name": "APP", 		"layout": { "name": "ApplicationFrame" }, 		"subRegions": [ 			{ "name": "CONTENT", "layout": { "name": "MasterDetail" } }, 			{ "name": "SIDEBAR", "layout": { "name": "Null" } }, 			{ "name": "MODAL", "layout": { "name": "Stack" } } 		] 	}, 	"defaultRegion": ["CONTENT"] } ``` |
```

The resulting region configuration then looks like this:

![region-configuration](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/region-configuration.svg)

##### Region Layout

For each region, the layout must be specified by name with optional settings data. The provided layouts of the Client are shown here:

![layouts](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/layouts.svg)

Please note that custom layouts can be easily installed and this setup is discussed further in the customization page.

Layouts for regions can be changed at runtime during a scene change, specifically by the `CLEAR_REGION` directive. See the page [Scene Changes](#/basics/application-model/scene-changes) for further details; this page also shows how to provide extra layout settings data in the dashboard example.

#### Locales

The property locales is optional and currently unused. However, it is recommended to provide here all locales that are used in the Application Model.

#### Modules

The Application Model is a composition of modules. The modules describe all the model aspects for a certain domain in your application. For example, an insurance application can be broken down into modules like partner, submission, offer and policy.

The idea here is that you can reuse modules and supporting code in different applications and put together modules to build up an application. This notion is expressed in the following diagram:

![modules](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/modules.png)

Modules contain two pieces of information:

* **Module header including a menu entry**: each module can provide a menu entry that is shown automatically in the menu bar in the header.
* **Flows**: a flow contains usually many scenes that handle activities in the respective domain and are connection between activities and the view assignments in regions. For example, the offer module might consist of three scenes: the overview (list), editing an offer and adding/editing clauses.

##### Bottom-up Development

The diagram above also shows the supposed bottom-up development process. You can break up the full application into smaller parts. You begin with single scene, like showing a search filter with results (an overview in A12 jargon) or a detail form. Scenes can be assigned to teams and developed and tested in isolation as a single-scene "application". You now can wire single scenes together for a user interaction scenario and bundle related scenarios (typically of the same business entity like offer) into a flow of a module e.g. "offer". A module is a mini-application that again can be tested in isolation, and the modules can then finally combined into the full application.

##### Starting an Initial Activity Through the Menu

The application menu is automatically built from the Application Model. Each module can specify a menu entry like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` { 	"menu": { 		"name": "offer", 		"label": { "en": "Offer" }, 		"initialActivity": { "descriptor": { "model": "Offer_v3" } } 	} } ``` |
```

When you click on a menu entry, an activity is started automatically with the Activity Descriptor content that is specified in the `descriptor` property. It is equivalent to `createPushActivityAction({ descriptor: {model: "Offer_v3"}, …​})`.

If the activity does not require any data loading, the property `withoutData` should be set. This is equivalent to the above push action with a `loadingState` set to `"without"`.

The label is localizable by providing different texts in a map. The key is hereby the string representation of the Locale object. Furthermore, it is possible to extend and override these texts with a [localizer](#/advanced/localization/localizer) by using the corresponding [localization key](#/advanced/localization/menu-entries). Using a customized localizer does not require that a label is provided in the Application Model.

#### Flows

A flow is a way to group together coupled UI interaction steps, we denote *scenes*. Examples of multi-step user interactions that could be modeled as flows are

* wizards that span multiple steps and involve more than one UI form on the Client [[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")], e.g. mixing forms, lists/overviews etc.
* drilling down into a hierarchy of information. Take the example from the [Design Study](#/basics/views/example-design-study): it starts with an overview of policy instances, then entering a specific policy document, and from here listing its general clauses, which are related or embedded information, and looking at various general clause instances of this list.

##### Starting a Flow

Flows are not directly instantiated and have no direct tie to activities. However, scenes are associated with activities through scene matches. And so we have a notion of *starting a flow* by the fact that an activity will match a first scene in flow. More on this topic in the following section.

##### Multiple Flows (Outlook)

Flows are currently limited by the fact, that you can only run one flow at time: if you click an entry in the main menu, you start off a new flow, and a possible ongoing flow is stopped by cancelling the activities. However, this limitation will be lifted in future releases and then multiple flows can be "started" in parallel. This plays nicely together with the fact that activities form not only a sequence (w.r.t. to the "initiated by" link), but trees and even forests. A forest here means that Client supports running multiple top-level activities that each can have tree-like sub activities.

Here’s an illustration of the idea of multiple flows spawned by multiple top-level activities:

![forrest](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/multiple-flows.svg)

#### Scenes

Now we enter the heart of the Application Model. Scenes are the connection between activities and the view changes in the UI that are driven by them.

The procedure is roughly as follows:

1. Selection criterion as **Match Condition** that has to match the Activity Descriptor of the given activity
2. Layout changes as **Scene Changes**

The following screenshot shows the UI views that are shown for an activity:

![module-case](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/module-scene.png)

##### Scene Match

Now we address the question of how to choose a scene in the model for the given activity. All scenes of the model are candidates and are checked via a scene match as follows.

The match conditions for a scene must evaluate to true. A selector evaluates a single attribute of the condition and can evaluate it against matches:

| Matches | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `mustEqual: string` | The value must match the string |
| `isSet: boolean` | A value for the given key must exist. The value can be anything. |

Let’s see an example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` { 	"matchCondition": [ 		{ "key": "model", "mustEqual": "Offer" }, 		{ "key": "instance", "isSet": false } 	] } ``` |
```

These match conditions evaluate to true for an Activity Descriptor like `{mode: "Offer" }`, but not for `{mode: "Offer", instance: "433" }`.

###### Required Prior Scene

Actually, there are two conditions that need to be met for a scene to be matched:

1. **Required Prior Scene** (optional): The name of the scene within the flow scope that has to be activated "before" (that is, it is the predecessor). It basically just means, that the parent activity of the activity that matches the scene must match this referenced prior scene.
2. The Match Condition as shown above.

###### Initial Scene for a Flow

A scene that does not have a required prior scene, can be matched by the match condition alone. This implies that this scene starts the flow, and thus we can derive the notion of initial scenes of flows. Note that

* there can be multiple initial scenes,
* and the ordering of scenes in the model is not relevant.

##### Example

Let’s look at the example from the previous [Flows](#/basics/application-model/flows) page and walk through the changes that happen:

![scene-match-example](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/scene-match-example.svg)

###### UI State 0: No Scene

* Let’s say there is a module with a main menu entry `AD = {model: "Offer", action: "list"}`.
* The user clicks on this main menu entry.
* A new activity with the above AD is created.
* Note that there is no initiating activity and hence no prior scene. Therefore, only the scene match with the AD properties is conducted among all existing scenes in the model.
* As result, the scene "Offer List" is matched and thus triggered. The directives in the scene "Offer List" are executed and the respective UI is configured. This effect is not shown in the diagram above but will be illustrated in the following page.

###### UI State 1: In Offer List

* The user clicks "edit" on the row representing the document "55".
* A new activity with the AD properties: `{"Offer", instance: "55", action: "edit"}` is created.
* This time, an initiating activity exists and it matches the AD of "Offer List" (this match is a consequence of the defined required prior scene "Offer List"). Additionally, the newly created activity matches the AD of "Edit Offer".
* **Mixing Different Model Types**: Now that we have "prior scene" as an additional scene match criteria, we can omit the model match criteria. This allows to edit documents of different types out of a common scene.
* The scene "Edit Offer" is triggered and the directives in the scene "Edit Offer" are executed (not shown) and the respective UI is configured.

###### UI State 2: In Edit Offer

* The user selects "edit clause" for clause 5.
* A new activity with the AD model: `{"Clause", instance: "5", action: "edit"}` is created.
* Again, an initiating activity exists, and it matches the AD of "Edit Offer". Additionally, the newly created activity matches the AD of "Edit Clause in Offer". Therefore the scene "Edit Clause in Offer" is triggered.
* The directives in the scene "Edit Clause in Offer" are executed (not shown) and the respective UI is configured.

#### Scene Changes

Scene changes consists of scene directives that reconfigure the UI, specifically the contained views and layout of regions.

Let’s just continue with the example from the [Scene](#/basics/application-model/scenes) page and refine it with the specific scene changes:

![flow-anatomy](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/scene-change-example.svg)

Here’s an excerpt of directives for a scene change:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` { 	"onEnter": [ 		{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR", "region": ["CONTENT"] }, 		{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "region": ["CONTENT"], "name": "OverviewCRUD" } 	], 	"onExit": [] } ``` |
```

The directives of a scene change are either in the `onEnter` or in the `onExit` scene changes:

* `onEnter` directives are executed when a scene is selected.
* `onExit` directives are executed when a scene is followed by a next one, i.e., when a new activity is created and this causes a new match condition. This group is for preparing a follow-up situation. Note that the scene with the `onExit` does not end – there is just another scene (change) now on top of it (or you might think of a new nested scene).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This is also the reason why there is no `onExit` directive for cases. Since cases are mutually exclusive and have no relationship to each other (e.g. there cannot be something like a "child" case), the condition "when a [case] is followed by a next one" would never be true in the first place. |

Example: if you don’t want to show the overview/list when a user selects an entry in the list, then you would change the scene example above to the following:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` { 	"onEnter": [ 		{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR", "region": ["CONTENT"] }, 		{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "region": ["CONTENT"], "name": "OverviewCRUD" } 	], 	"onExit": [{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR", "region": ["CONTENT"] }] } ``` |
```

Scene changes can be given on the scene level but also on the [case](#/basics/application-model/cases) level. Scene changes on the scene level are always executed additional and before to any selected case.

The available directives are:

| Directive | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `REGION_CLEAR` | Changes the layout of a region. It can have (optional) geometry information which can be used by the layout to position its placeholders (into which the views are placed). The structure of the geometry information is therefore layout specific. |
| `VIEW_ADD` | Adds a view to a certain region. You must specify a `name` property, which specifies the UI component by name that is to be shown in the view. The name is resolved during view rendering by looking for a match among the registered UI components. Optionally it is possible to specify view specific constraints that effects the layouts. |

Here some more sample excerpts:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` { 	"onEnter": [ 		{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR", "layout": { "name": "Stack" } }, 		{ 			"type": "VIEW_ADD", 			"name": "OverviewCRUD", 			"models": [{ "modelType":"overview", "name":"DiveLogOverview" }] 		} 	] } ``` |
```

1. The `REGION_CLEAR` directive can change the layout of the regions.
2. The `VIEW_ADD` directive can provide specific model document names to use in the engine of the view. Here the Overview Model has the very specific "DiveLogOverview" ID.

To better understand the assignment of views to regions, it helps to think of a region as a container of views:

* A view is always added to the end of the view list of its region.
* By clearing a region explicitly with the `REGION_CLEAR` directive, you remove all previous views from the region.
* Replaying: The view list of a region is rebuilt if any new activity is created or when an activity is finished.

##### The Replay Algorithm

(This section contains very technical information that is optional.)

You might wonder why there is no directive to remove a view or other means for cleaning up the views that were added. But cleaning up is not required because it is done automatically. This works like this: if an activity is finished, the view assignment is reconstructed by the following **replaying algorithm**:

1. Let’s assume that activity `Ax` has finished and thus is removed from the list of activities `{A1, A2, …​, Ax, …​, An}`
2. The leftover list `{A1, A2, …​, An}` is replayed
3. Reset all assignments of views to regions, so that they are empty.
4. `A_previous := undefined`
5. Run a loop over `A1` up to `An` with `A_i` as the loop variable:

   1. If `A_previous !== undefined`: execute the directives of the `onNext` group of `A_previous` (including the `onNext` directives of the selected view of `A_previous`).
   2. Find the matching scene for `A_i` and execute the directives of its `onEnter` group (including the `onEnter` directives of the selected view).
   3. `A_previous := A_i`

The replaying algorithm is performed as a Redux selector called `region`.

##### Layout Changes

Even though regions are setup in the [Region Configuration](#/basics/application-model/configuration-of-regions) part of the model, you can easily reconfigure the layout of any region in a scene change.

Let’s illustrate this reconfiguration of the region layout by implementing a dashboard. The layout "Dashboard" is already provided by the Client. We just need to set it up with a specific columns/rows configuration, so that the dashboard’s tiles can be positioned properly. The layout setting consists of a list of rows. Each row contains either a number of views or a list of container columns.

Let’s implement this sample dashboard layout:

![dashboard-screenshot](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/dashboard-screenshot.png)

First, we break it down into the rows and columns like this:

![dashboard-scene](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/dashboard-layout.svg)

The dashboard should be assigned to a single activity. Thus, we set up the region for the dashboard with a `REGION_CLEAR` directive and the following layout setting. Additionally, we add the five views to the region in the right order. These views will then be placed into dashboard tiles by the dashboard layout.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 ``` | ``` { 	"sceneChange": { 		"onEnter": [ 			{ 				"type": "REGION_CLEAR", 				"layout": { 					"name": "Dashboard", 					"settings": { 						"rows": [ 							{ 								"columns": [ 									{ "width": { "sm": 3, "md": 4, "lg": 9 } }, 									{ 										"width": { "sm": 1, "md": 2, "lg": 3 }, 										"rows": [ 											{ "columns": [ { "width": { "sm": 4, "md": 6, "lg": 12 } } ] }, 											{ "columns": [ { "width": { "sm": 4, "md": 6, "lg": 12 } } ] } 										] 									} 								] 							}, 							{ 								"columns": [ 									{ "width": { "sm": 4, "md": 2, "lg": 4 } }, 									{ "width": { "sm": 4, "md": 4, "lg": 8 } } 								] 							} 						] 					} 				} 			}, 			{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "DashboardIntroTile" }, 			{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "DashboardCalendarTile" }, 			{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "DashboardNotesTile" }, 			{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "DashboardTasksTile" }, 			{ 				"type": "VIEW_ADD", 				"name": "OverviewCRUD", 				"models": [ { "modelType": "overview", "name": "CRUD-overview" } ] 			} 		] 	} } ``` |
```

Note that the region is not explicitly given in the directives, since the "CONTENT" region is the default one, as it was specified in the [Region Configuration](#/basics/application-model/configuration-of-regions) part of the Application Model.

In summary, this is how we modelled the dashboard:

![dashboard-single-activity](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/dashboard-single-activity.svg)

To follow up on the dashboard idea, if the user clicks a row in the overview in view 5, a form should come up. This form is of course a new activity, which in turn triggers a new scene. Let’s assume that the dashboard in the "CONTENT" region should disappear while the overview is shown, even on desktops with enough width to show both. Well, discarding the dashboard activity is not an option. There are two obvious options: using an `REGION_CLEAR` directive in either the `onExit` scene change of the dashboard scene or the `onEnter` scene change of the overview scene. The former looks like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` { "onExit": [{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR", "region": ["CONTENT"], "layout": "MasterDetail" }] } ``` |
```

#### Cases

Cases are an optional feature and can be defined within a scene. Think of them as mutual exclusive user interface components for editing the data. For example, when editing an offer, one case is the general data form, another case is the terms & conditions and yet another one is the coverages list. All these details are contained in the same offer document, but the designers broke it down into different cases.

Specifically, a case has

* A label which is typically shown in the sidebar menu and is localizable by providing different texts in a map. The key is hereby the string representation of the Locale object. Furthermore, it is possible to extend and override these texts with a [localizer](#/advanced/localization/localizer) by using the corresponding [localization key](#/advanced/localization/cases). Using a customized localizer does not require that a label is provided in the Application Model.
* Scene changes with **directives**: The selected case contains a scene change that is executed after the scene change on the scene level. One typically places view with Engines here, while the case agnostic sidebar is setup on the scene level.

Only one case of a scene can be active (thus, mutual exclusive). This is tracked by the activity, which has a property `case` for the current case. If you change this case property, the region is updated (via the replay algorithm) to update the view assignment to regions.

When model descriptors are given in the onEnter directives of cases, the models will lazily be loaded once the case is active.

A menu of available cases can be shown by just adding the standard UI "GenericCaseMenu" component with a sidebar region. The menu then shows the name for each case, and with a click on a menu entry, the respective case is selected and the directives of the case’s `onEnter` group are executed.

Here’s an example scene that offers three cases and uses the GenericCaseMenu UI component:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ``` | ``` { 	"scenes": [ 		{ 			"name": "Edit Offer", 			"description": "Specific Offer", 			"matchCondition": [ 				{ "key": "model", "mustEqual": "Offer" }, 				{ "key": "instance", "isSet": true } 			], 			"sceneChange": { 				"onEnter": [ 					{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "region": "SIDEBAR", "name": "OfferActions" }, 					{ "type": "VIEW_ADD", "region": "SIDEBAR", "name": "GenericCaseMenu" } 				] 			}, 			"defaultCase": "general", 			"cases": [ 				{ 					"name": "general", 					"label": { "en": "General" }, 					"sceneChange": { "onEnter": [ { "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "GenericForm" } ] } 				}, 				{ 					"name": "terms", 					"label": { "en": "Terms & Conditions (General Conditions)" }, 					"sceneChange": { "onEnter": [ { "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "TermsConditions" } ] } 				}, 				{ 					"name": "coverages", 					"label": { "en": "Coverages" }, 					"sceneChange": { "onEnter": [ { "type": "VIEW_ADD", "name": "GenericOverview" } ] } 				} 			] 		} 	] } ``` |
```

The following diagram shows the situation where an activity is matched to this "Offer" scene and the cases are switched from "general" to "terms":

![views](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/model/cases-example.svg)

If the case "general" is selected, the resulting UI looks like this:

![cases](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/views-example/anatomy.png)

When the cases are switched from "general" to "terms", the UI adapts like this:

1. Removal of the views specified for the previous case "general", i.e., the case with "GenericForm" UI component.
2. Addition of the view specified for the new view "terms", i.e., the view with "TermsConditions" UI component.

##### Cases Versus Traditional "Tabs"

Some UIs use the "tabs" approach with only one tab being shown at a time. However, this is very physical. By introducing cases as an abstraction, you are free to come with any physical rendering you like. And quite easily so, by means of choosing the right layout (for the tabbed UI, you can easily provide a layout that shows views in exclusive tabs) for the "CONTENT" region.

### Data Loading

The Client provides a powerful data loading concept. Whenever a scene gets activated for an activity the Client evaluates if data loading is needed. This evaluation can be described as the following:

1. If the matching scene has models defined, e.g. `models: [{ modelType: "form", name: "Product" }]`, the runtime automatically performs model and data loading in parallel.
2. If the matching scene has no models defined, but the boolean flag `loadData: true`, the runtime automatically performs data loading.
3. In all other cases, no data loading is performed.

You can always, dispatch an `ActivityActions.loadData` to trigger the data loading for a specific activity id.

#### DataHandlers

The Client supports three kinds of DataHandlers: DataLoader, DataEditor and DataProvider. They are described in more detail in the upcoming sections.
Additionally, a union type `DataHandler` is provided for convenience, combining the three types.

By using DataLoader or DataEditor, the runtime provides some default behavior for some data operation.

* **save:** after saving, it dispatches an ActivityActions.reload of the current activity. If you pass the `updateActivityData` flag to the action’s payload of save/commit, the Client updates the activity’s data with the response data of the save request.
* **delete:** before executing the delete request, the Client first tries to cancel all child activities of the current one. After the delete operation, it triggers a reload for the overview activity, if there is one.

If you do not want to have any of these, you should implement the data operation with a DataProvider. There is no default behavior for DataProvider. The runtime simply calls the `provideData()` function.

##### Registration and Order of Execution

DataHandlers are registered in the application setup. For each data operation, the runtime tries to find a matching DataHandler in the following order:

1. DataProviders and DataEditors provided via the [Module API](#/advanced/module-api) (in order of Module registration)
2. DataEditors provided in the application setup (regardless of their position in the array!)
3. DataProviders and DataLoaders provided in the application setup (following their position in the array)

The runtime first evaluates DataProviders and DataEditors for all registered modules, before looking at the handlers from the application setup. Note that while the order of the setup is important, any DataEditors in the array will always be evaluated first.
In the following example, the runtime would first query the `DocumentDataEditor`, then the `DataLoader` and afterwards the `DataProvider`, if one of them can handle a DataHolder of the current activity. The first matching DataHandler is going to perform the data operation.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` const dataHandlers: DataHandler[] = [ 	new DocumentDataEditor(), 	new DataLoader(), 	new DataProvider() 	/* ... */ ] ``` |
```

##### DataLoader and DataEditor

DataLoaders handle the exchange of business data with external systems. DataEditors on the other hand handle exchange of business data between activities.

DataLoaders support the following actions:

* load
* save
* delete

DataEditors support the following actions:

* read
* write

Any number of DataLoaders and DataEditors can be configured but for every data action, only one DataLoader or DataEditor will be used. The selection happens as follows:

* Each DataLoader is asked if it can handle the current Activity. The first matching DataLoader is executed .
* Each DataEditor is checked if it matches the current Activity and an ancestor of it using [match conditions](#/basics/views/match-conditions).
  A DataEditor defines parent and child match conditions. It matches for an activity if all the child match conditions of the editor match the Activity Descriptor and if all the parent match conditions match an Activity Descriptor of an ancestor (defined by the initiating activity id) of this activity. The ancestor activities are checked bottom to top (first the direct parent of the activity). The first matching DataEditor is executed and the data is read/written from/to the matched ancestor activity.

Both DataLoaders and DataEditors only handle the data of the activity’s default DataHolder, which is the one that has the same descriptor as the activity. Handling the data of additional DataHolders is supported via DataProviders.

##### DataProvider

A DataProvider can also handle the exchange of business data with external systems as well as the exchange of data between activities. Since it is a wrapper around a redux-saga function, it can fetch data, access the Redux store via selectors or dispatch actions via action creators.

DataProviders support the following actions:

* load
* save
* delete

Any number of DataProviders can be registered in the application setup. Every DataProvider is asked if it can handle a DataHolder for the current activity. A DataProvider can handle an arbitrary number of DataHolders, but each DataHolder can only be handled by one DataProvider.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Among other properties, the triggering action is passed to the `canHandle` method of each Data Provider. This makes it possible to limit the scope of a Data Provider based on the presence of certain model types in a scene. See the [documentation about DataReducer](#/basics/access-models-in-scene) on how to extract them from the action payload. |

After the selection of all DataHolders is finished, each DataProvider gets its list of DataHolders to load. Additionally, each provider has access to the payload of the action that triggered it via the `details` property (see example below).

If a `"loading"` or `"saving"` error should be set to a specific non-default DataHolder, then a custom action and custom DataReducers are required.

###### When to use a DataProvider compared to a DataLoader

DataLoaders are intended for simple use cases like "loading a single document" or "loading a list of documents". Since the methods are asynchronous, requests can be made to fetch some data, which will then be stored in the default DataHolder of the activity.
Only if your logic is more complicated than that, the more low-level API of a DataProvider should be used. Since these methods are implemented as sagas, they have full access to the redux state of the application, which allows them for example to handle different DataHolders.

###### Empty Document DataProvider

In order to enable the creation of empty document by the Client itself, the form-engine extension provides a DataProvider factory function (`createEmptyDocumentDataProvider`). This factory returns a DataProvider that creates an empty document with initial values and pre-computed values if a new document should be loaded.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Without this DataProvider another DataHandler has to handle the request for loading a new document. |

###### Example

The following example shows an implementation of a DataProvider to load documents from an API and putting them into the current activity’s data property.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ``` | ``` const DocumentsDataProvider: DataProvider = { 	name: "DocumentsDataProvider", 	canHandle({ dataHolder, operation }) { 		switch (operation) { 			case "load": 				return dataHolder.descriptor.instance !== undefined; 			case "save": 			case "delete": 				return false; 			default: 				throw new Error(`No support for ${operation}.`); 		} 	}, 	*provideData({ activityId, dataHolders, operation, details }) { 		switch (operation) { 			case "load": 				const documents = yield all( 					dataHolders.map(({ descriptor }) => 						// getDocumentById fetches data from a external source and returns a promise 						call(getDocumentById, `/documents/${descriptor.instance}`) 					)); 				yield put(ActivityActions.setData({ activityId, data: documents })); 				break; 			case "save": 			case "delete": 			default: 				throw new Error(`No support for ${operation}.`); 		} 	} }; ``` |
```

### Data Reducers

A DataReducer is a Client-specific extension of the reducer concept from Redux.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is recommended to put as much logic as possible in reducers as can be read in the [redux best practice style guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#put-as-much-logic-as-possible-in-reducers). |

Like a standard Redux reducer it is triggered by Redux actions. However, since DataReducers are only concerned with the data slice of an activity, they can only handle activity-related actions and then, once triggered, calculate the update of all DataHolders of the respective activity.

The interface of a DataReducer is quite similar to that of a DataHandler, but only consists of the `reduce` method. This function changes the given DataHolders in the Redux store.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` export interface DataReducer { 	/** 		* Can be registered as sub-reducers within the activity reducer. It enables you to perform any kind of dataHolder update, e.g. 		* - adding dataHolder(s) 		* - changing dataHolder(s) 		* - removing dataHolder(s) 		* 		* @param dataHolders All dataHolders for the activity specified by the id in the action payload. 		* @param action The triggering action 		* @param defaultDataHolder The default dataHolder of the activity, `undefined` if none exists 		* to keep the existing behavior of `isDefaultDataHolder` 		*/ 	reduce( 		dataHolders: Activity.DataHolder[], 		action: ActivityActions.DataReducerAction, 		defaultDataHolder?: Activity.DataHolder 	): Activity.DataHolder[]; } ``` |
```

#### Adding a DataReducer

Below is a sample implementation of a DataReducer that reacts to a specific action and then handles its respective payload.
The exemplary DataReducer is implemented in a way that it will only update a specific DataHolder of the activity.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ``` | ``` const actionCreator = actionCreatorFactory("Example");  /** Example action to add a new Todo item to the list of ToDos */ export const addTodo = actionCreator<AddTodoPayload>("ADD_TODO");  /** The payload of the addTodo action. */ export interface AddTodoPayload extends ActivityActions.ActivityActionPayload { 	readonly todo: string; }  /** Todo list data structure to manage in a DataHolder */ export interface TodoList { 	readonly todos: string[]; }  /** Helper function to assert the type of a DataHolder */ export function isTodoDataHolder(dh: Activity.DataHolder): dh is Activity.DataHolder<TodoList> { 	return dh.descriptor.use === "todo-list"; }  export const AddTodoDataReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 	reduce(dataHolders, action, defaultDataHolder) { 		return addTodo.match(action) 			? dataHolders.map(dh => { 					return isTodoDataHolder(dh) 						? { 								...dh, 								data: { 									...dh.data, 									todos: [...(dh.data?.todos ?? []), action.payload.todo] 								} 							} 						: dh; 				}) 			: dataHolders; 	} }; ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is important to note that the trigger action should either extend `ActivityActions.ActivityActionPayload` or `ActivityActions.AsyncActivityActionPayload`. Otherwise, the action payload would not contain the activity identifier and thus would not link it to any activity in the Redux store. |

The integration of a DataReducer can happen in two ways:

1. The DataReducer can be provided with the `ApplicationFactories.Config` object as a part of the general application setup using the `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup` function.
2. The DataReducer can be provided via the [Module API](#/advanced/module-api) as a module-specific DataReducer.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | When writing DataReducers, care must be taken in order to avoid unwanted state changes. Consider the following example (same as above):  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` // this reducer only looks for a specific action and just returns the unchanged dataHolders array otherwise const addTodoReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 	reduce(dataHolders, action) { 		return TodoActions.addTodo.match(action) ? dataHolders?.map(handleAddTodo(action)) : dataHolders; 	} } ``` | ```  This reducer will NOT change the state if the action type does not match by returning the same object reference. This allows any activity-related actions (e.g. "loadData") that need to be handled by Client’s own reducer to actually "reach" them.  In comparison, consider this reducer:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` // this reducer always changes the state, regardless of the action! DO NOT COPY THIS! const doNotUseThisReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 	reduce(dataHolders, action) { 		return dataHolders?.map(dh => TodoActions.addTodo.match(action) ? handleAddTodo(action)(dh) : dh); 	} } ``` | ```  Because mapping an array always creates a new object reference, this reducer will create a state change for ALL activity-related actions, even in cases where the actual DataHolder content will not be touched at all.  Now, none of the Client-internal actions will ever reach their intended reducer, because all of them are already handled. **Registering reducers using this pattern effectively breaks Client!** |

#### Using the Default DataHolder

The `reduce()` method of the API contains the defaultDataHolder as a third parameter. When iterating over the existing DataHolders, you can use this to check whether the current DataHolder is the default one.
For example like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` const addTodoReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 		reduce(dataHolders, action, defaultDataHolder) { 			return TodoActions.addTodo.match(action) ? dataHolders.map(dh => dh === defaultDataHolder ? updateDataHolder(dh, action) : dh) : dataHolders; 		} 	} ``` |
```

In case your setup contains multiple DataReducers that all want to change the default DataHolder, checking for its existence as shown above will not work, because the first reducer will create a new object reference for it. In such cases, you will need to perform the check on a lower level (e.g. by comparing the descriptors).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `defaultDataHolder` parameter will be `undefined` if no default DataHolder exists for the activity. |

#### How to Add New DataHolders

The API is capable of creating DataHolders.
Additionally, if your setup requires you to add multiple data holders at the same time, switching from multiple dispatched actions to a single data reducer might be a performance gain.

Consider the following example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` function addDataHolders(action: Action<CustomTriggerPayload>, dataHolders: Activity.DataHolder[]) {  	// based on the action payload, create new DHs here 	const newDataHolders = []  	// add them to the existing ones 	return [ 		...dataHolders, 		...newDataHolders 	] }  const customTriggerReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 		reduce(dataHolders, action) { 			return customTriggerAction.match(action) ? addDataHolders(action, dataHolders) : dataHolders; 		} 	} ``` |
```

Because a reducer is just a function without side effects, the code can easily be unit-tested.

In case the creation of a DataHolder from inside your existing saga depends on other data from state, you can either:
. select the data beforehand and pass it as payload when dispatching your trigger action
. select the data inside your reducer factory function. Note that this only works for module-specific DataReducers (added via the [Module API](#/advanced/module-api)).

#### Accessing models of the current scene

To work with the referenced models of the current activity scene, A12 Client automatically injects all models of the scene together with the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) into the payloads of activity actions.

Inside your reducer, the models can then be accessed like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` export const customReducer: ActivityReducers.DataReducer = { 	reduce(dataHolders, action) {  		// or use AsyncActivityActionPayload 		if (ActivityActions.isActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload(action.payload)) { 			const { modelGraph, modelsInScene } = action.payload;  			// use modelsInScene 		}  		return dataHolders; 	} }; ``` |
```

In case the scene does not include any models, `modelsInScene` will be an empty array.
Note that depending on the loading state, each element in `modelsInScene` can be one of:

* the loaded model
* a model error, when loading was already attempted and failed
* a model descriptor, when the model was not loaded yet (in this case the Model Graph could be used, e.g. to find references)

### Model Loading

The complete rendering of views in the Client is often based on the availability of certain A12 models: Document Models, Form Models, Overview Models or Tree Models.
Those models describe the behavior of the view and that is why they need to be referenced in the respective Application Model fragments, i.e. in "VIEW\_ADD" directives.

The Client library will load the required models (once) for all active views and also consider the dependencies between different models in order to also load all implicitly referenced models.

In order to make sure that those models are only used if they are actually compatible with the application, the Client Model Loader also checks whether the loaded models are version compatible to the libraries that those models belong to.
I.e. tree models must match the model version that the Tree Engine expects, Form Models must match the model version that the Form Engine version expects and so on.

This check requires a model type to model version mapping to be available to the Client library. This can be achieved by injecting a respective mapping object into the bundled javascript during the bundling step in the build process.
One example solution is part of the webpack configuration of the A12 project template.

### Summary

Let’s summarize what we’ve learned so far. Here are the key concepts:

* Regions: the application frame defines two regions: content area and sidebar. Each region contains views and uses a layout manager to derive which views are visible and how they are arranged.
* Activity: a user is always engaged in an activity like an overview or editing a form. Activities can be nested in a possible recursive master/detail manner. The next section explains activities further.
* Case: an activity can offer multiple cases, e.g., a complex business objects like an insurance policy can be broken down into different cases like general data, risks, terms&conditions, etc.
* Views: The views of a regions are derived by the activities and the current selected scene and case (through a mechanism called *condition matching*, which is explained in the [Application Model](#/basics/application-model) section).

## Features

This chapter describes the features of the A12 Client in detail.

### Composable Appsetup

In the regular appsetup, you are responsible for combining all the necessary setup code for each A12 Component with your own setup code and provide the result to A12 Client. This includes for example reducers, sagas or DataHandlers. You are also expected to call specific function, dispatch specific actions or wrap your React components with specific contexts. With the new API, each A12 Component is now responsible for their own setup.

Another advantage is the compile-time validation of the config. Each component may declare other features, that they depend on or that must not exist. The type of the config will become 'never' if that happens.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The older appsetup is still supported and can even be mixed with the composable appsetup. While we recommend switching A12 based code to the new setup for easier integration and reduced maintenance effort, your own setup can continue to use the old config.  When migrating to the new API, remember to remove A12 specific setup code. In addition to the code provided to the old appsetup, remove A12 specific React contexts and view/layout/regionProvider. |

Composable Appsetup

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 ``` | ``` // the composable appsetup is build on top of the old config, which continues to work // you can either use it or the more functional setup described below and keep it empty const clientConfig: BaseConfig = { 	// your reducers, middlewares, sagas, data handlers, etc. 	additionalMiddlewares: [customMiddleware], 	// additionally, view/layout/regionProvider can now be specified here 	// remember to remove any A12 specific components, 	layouts: layoutProvider };  const initialConfig: A12ApplicationConfig = { 	config: clientConfig, 	localization: { 		supportedLocales: [ 			{ 				country: "US", 				language: "en", 				name: localizableFromLocalizationTreeMap("languages.english", localizations) 			} 		] 	} };  const finalConfig = combineFeatures( 	// Engines 	combineFeatures(withFormEngine, withTreeEngine), 	// Model Loading 	combineFeatures(withModel(appModel), withPlatformModelLoader), 	// Client Extensions 	combineFeatures(withDirtyHandling, withLocalization), 	// Custom Setup 	combineFeatures(addView("MyView", CustomView), addWrapper(CustomContext)) )(initialConfig);  const { store, initialActions, Component } = createA12ApplicationSetup(finalConfig);  await initialActions(); const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!); root.render(<Provider store={store}>{Component}</Provider>); ``` |
```

#### Client Extensions

A12 Client itself not only provides the composable API, but provides some extensions that can be registered with the API. For a description of a specific feature, see the following paragraphs.

Client Extensions

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` combineFeatures( 	withAppModelAdapter, 	withDataServicesConfiguration, 	withDeepLinking, 	withDirtyHandling, 	withLocalization, 	withPlatformModelLoader, 	withNotifications ); ``` |
```

### Root Reducer

In most cases, your own reducers will either work on custom top level slices of the state (using the `reducerMap` property of the `ApplicationSetup`) or on certain activities (using [Data Reducer](#/basics/data-reducers)).

However, these APIs will not work when wanting to work on the default slices of Client itself.
To achieve this, it is possible to customize the root reducer as a whole: this lets you intercept actions, add your own logic to default actions, while still being able to delegate to the default reducer if necessary.

Consider the following example:

Example of a custom root reducer

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` import type { Reducer } from "redux";  import { ApplicationFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  declare const otherConfig: ApplicationFactories.Config;  const customRootReducer: (defaultReducer: Reducer<object>) => Reducer<object> = 	defaultReducer => (state, action) => { 		switch (action.type) { 			case "CUSTOM_ACTION": { 				// handle custom action here 				return { ...state, custom: true }; 			}  			// fall back to the default root reducer to make sure 			// the default Client actions are handled properly 			default: 				return defaultReducer(state, action); 		} 	};  ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ ...otherConfig, rootReducer: customRootReducer }); ``` |
```

Here we define a custom root reducer that handles a specific action (`"CUSTOM_ACTION"`) and falls back to the default root reducer for all other actions.
Note that because our custom action wants to update the top level of the Client state, using something like a [Data Reducer](#/basics/data-reducers) would not be possible here (since these only work per Activity).
This ensures that your custom logic is applied without affecting the default Client behavior.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Instead of using a switch statement, you could also use the `.match()` method provided by action creators to distinguish actions. |

#### Lenses

Lenses are a functional programming concept adapted here for state management. In the context of A12 Client, a lens is a plain object with a getter and a setter, allowing you to read and update a specific part of the redux state in a type-safe and composable way.
This is especially useful when customizing the root reducer, when default Client behavior should be overridden / changed.

Compared to selectors, which only read state, lenses provide both read and write access.

Lenses are available for all slices of the Client state, namely:

| Client state slice | lens namespace |
| --- | --- |
| `activities` | `ActivityLenses` |
| `application` | `ApplicationLenses` |
| `locale` | `LocaleLenses` |
| `models` | `ModelLenses` |
| `notifications` | `NotificationLenses` |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | There is no specific lens for the ApplicationModel inside the `models` slice. To programmatically change flows, regions and menus, implement the corresponding selectors with the `DynamicConfiguration` API instead. |

##### Basic Example

Consider this example showing how to use a lens to update the `locale` slice in your root reducer:

Example of a custom root reducer using the LocaleLenses

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` import type { Reducer } from "redux"; import { actionCreatorFactory } from "typescript-fsa";  import { LocaleLenses } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { Locale } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization/lib/main/localization/Locale.js";  // a custom action to set the locale from a string export const customLocaleAction = actionCreatorFactory()<{ 	readonly localeString: string; }>("CUSTOM_SET_LOCALE");  export const rootReducerWithLocaleLens: (defaultReducer: Reducer<object>) => Reducer<object> = 	defaultReducer => (state, action) => { 		return customLocaleAction.match(action) && state 			? // using the locale lens to perform the state update 				LocaleLenses.locale.set(Locale.fromString(action.payload.localeString) as Locale)(state) 			: defaultReducer(state, action); 	}; ``` |
```

Here, we define a custom action to set a locale from a string. When dispatched, the reducer uses the `LocaleLenses.locale()` lens to update the default `locale` slice in the state.
Other actions, including all the default ones from Client, will go through the default reducer, leaving their behavior unchanged.

#### Complete Example

The following example demonstrates how you can use multiple lenses to handle both custom actions and default Client actions:

Example of a custom root reducer using the different Lenses from Client

```

"";  	// then use lenses to update the state some more 	const updateIfActivityPresent = modifyIfPresent(updateDescriptor); 	return modifyWithLens(ActivityLenses.activity(parentActivityId))(updateIfActivityPresent)( 		nextState 	); } ``` |
```

As seen in the example, you can choose to override the default behavior or delegate to the default reducer and then use lenses to further update the state. This flexibility makes the API very powerful for advanced use cases.

|  | When handling default Client actions in your custom root reducer, be careful not to break the Client behavior. Always make sure to handle these actions properly, or fallback to the default reducer. |

### Model Loader

The *modelLoader* extension provides the functionality to load different kinds of models from different locations.

We distinguish between loading models directly from the platform server (Platform Model Loading) or from other locations, e.g. a different server or your local file system (HTTP Model Loading). Model loading also varies for different kinds of models, e.g. for a Document Model it is also necessary to load the corresponding validation code.

The extension provides a single generic loader, which can be used to load all kinds of models. For Document models, the loader will additionally perform post-processing by default (deserializing the model and adding the validation code).

This model loader is internally customized with different fetching mechanisms to be used for both HTTP Model Loading and Platform Model Loading.

#### ModelLoader API

Both extensions provide an API for parallel model loading.
The implementation provides a single generic loader, which can be used to load all kinds of models. Both the fetching and the post-processing mechanism can be customized.

##### HTTP Model Loading

With the public factory function *createHttpModelLoader* you can retrieve the model loader for HTTP Model Loading, which uses the fetch API for loading. The base path from which the models should be loaded and the post-processing of models can be configured by passing it to the factory function.
If no base path is given, the root path "/" will be used.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` const modelLoader = createHttpModelLoader({ basePath: "/models/", modelProcessors: [] }); ``` |
```

##### Platform Model Loading

Platform Model Loading reuses the model loader from the *HTTP Connectors* extension, but sets a different fetching mechanism, using RPC operations for batch-loading models.

###### Providing a Custom Server Connector

This loader respects the Services API and uses the `ConnectorLocator`. Therefore, it is possible to provide your implementation following the [Simple Example](#ConnectorLocator) API. This can be used to modify the authentication filters as well as provide a custom server connector.

Simple Example

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` // Configure your server connector e.g. using UAA ConnectorLocator.createInstance(serverConnector); ``` |
```

###### Note about behavior

The `ModelLoader` API performs **parallel** model loading. To achieve this, the Model Graph is used to find all referenced models before the actual loading is started, allowing the loader to load everything "at once".
Therefore, when using the API make sure to initialize the Model Graph on application startup. This is required as the new API uses the Model Graph to resolve all references. See the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) and the A12 Services documentation for more information.

##### ModelProcessor API

The `ModelLoader` API is designed to load all models in parallel. To be able to handle models differently depending on their type, the `ModelProcessor` API can be used.

Usage of ModelProcessor API

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` export interface ModelProcessor { 	/** 	 * The type of model this processor can handle 	 */ 	readonly modelType: string; 	/** 	 * How to process the model 	 * 	 * @param loadedModel The loaded model, also contains validation code for document models 	 * @param referencedModels All referenced models from the header 	 * @returns A post-processed model or an error 	 */ 	processModel(loadedModel: ModelAPI, referencedModels: ModelMap): ModelAPI | Model.Error; } ``` |
```

In case your processing logic needs access to the referenced models, they are included as the second parameter.
See the customization section below for additional information.

##### Implementing a Custom ModelLoader

###### Fetching models

The actual loading of models can be customized by passing your own implementation of a `ModelFetcher`. Note that by default, Client expects a valid ModelGraph to be able to find all referenced models.
When the `ModelFetcher` is called, Client will pass all of the resolved model descriptors at once, allowing the fetcher to perform parallel loading.

As a consequence, using the default `ModelLoader` implementation by Client requires a ModelGraph (without it, model loading will break even for a single ui model, since already the referenced Document Model would not be found).

However, in case setting up a `ModelGraph` is not wanted or not possible, the API can still be used, requiring you to write a custom model fetcher instead. Since the fetcher will only get the models in scene without any resolved dependencies, the logic might look like this:

1. Load all models that are given (in most cases, this will be a single model: the UI model of the current scene, for example a form)
2. When loading is done, manually extract referenced models from the header
3. For each found model, perform loading again (starting at 1.)

While this approach would allow circumventing the need for a ModelGraph, please note that it also hinders performance. In case there are a lot of referenced models, loading them like this will trigger a waterfall of requests, potentially slowing down your application.

###### Post-processing models

In addition to customizing the model fetching, it is also possible to customize the post-processing of loaded models with the `ModelProcessor` API e.g. like this:

Usage of ModelProcessor API

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` export const customModelProcessor: ModelProcessor = { 	modelType: "overview", 	processModel(model, referencedModels) { 		// any custom logic for a loaded overview model  		// for example, accessing and checking the referenced document model 		const documentModelRef = model.header.modelReferences?.find( 			ref => ref.modelType === "document" 		); 		const documentModel = referencedModels[documentModelRef?.reference ?? ""]; 		if (!documentModel) { 			return { 				type: "POST_PROCESSING_FAILED", 				message: "Document model not found" 			}; 		}  		// in any case, return either the processed model OR an error describing why/how the processing failed 		return model; 	} }; ``` |
```

Both the http and the platform loader factories allow passing a list of `ModelProcessor`s. Since Client already includes post-processing by default for Document Models, the following rules apply:

* There is always only one `ModelProcessor` applied (if there are multiple passed for the same model type, the first one wins)
* If there exists a custom `ModelProcessor` for Document Models, it will be applied **instead** of the default.
* If no `ModelProcessor` is passed, Client will always fall back to the default processing logic for Document Models

If you need to write your own `ModelLoader`, the default `ModelProcessor` from Client for Document Models is available as a convenience.

###### Customizing the loader itself

You can also implement a custom ModelLoader yourself. To achieve this you first need to implement the `ModelLoader` interface as shown in the example below and afterwards register your custom model loader in the appsetup of your application.

The ModelLoader interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` export interface ModelLoader { 	/** 	 * A unique name to identify the loader 	 */ 	readonly name: string;  	/** 	 * Loads an A12 model together with all of its referenced models. 	 * 	 * @param modelDescriptors List of model descriptors to load 	 * @param existingModels Map of already existing models, useful if post processing 	 * needs access to models that were not loaded 	 */ 	load(modelDescriptors: Model.Descriptor[], existingModels: ModelMap): Promise<ModelMap>; } ``` |
```

Example of a simple ModelLoader implementation

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ``` | ``` export class CustomModelLoader implements ModelLoader { 	readonly name: string = "CustomModelLoader";  	constructor(protected basePath: string = "/") {}  	private async loadSingleModel( 		descriptor: Model.Descriptor 	): Promise<{ name: string; result: ModelAPI | Model.Error }> { 		try { 			const response = await fetch(`${this.basePath}${descriptor.name}.json`); 			const jsonContent = await response.json();  			if (!isModelInstance(jsonContent)) { 				throw new Error("not a valid model"); 			}  			return { name: descriptor.name, result: jsonContent }; 		} catch (error) { 			return { 				name: descriptor.name, 				result: { type: "MY_MODEL_ERROR", source: error } 			}; 		} 	}  	async load(descriptors: Model.Descriptor[]): Promise<ModelMap> { 		// load models in parallel 		const results = await Promise.all( 			descriptors.map(descriptor => this.loadSingleModel(descriptor)) 		);  		// apply post processing if needed 		return results.reduce((modelMap, { name, result }) => { 			return { ...modelMap, [name]: result }; 		}, {} as ModelMap); 	} } ``` |
```

While the examples above can be used as a starting point, please note that this API is designed to only provide a single loader. Therefore, if you need to customize the processing of specific model types, you will still need to implement processing for all of them.

#### Custom Model Loading

Independent of the default model loading of the Client it is possible to handle model loading yourself. In order to prevent interference with the default model loading only models should be handled that are not referenced by the Application Model and their transitive dependencies.

Handling the model loading yourself has some implications, because without the model descriptors in the Application Model no automatic data loading will happen and Engine views are not able to resolve their models. Therefore, you have to provide your own DataProviders and views.

In the following example you can see a simple custom model loading saga. For more details about setting models please have a look the `ModelActions.setModels` action documentation.

Example of a custom model loading saga

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ``` | ``` export function* loadModels(): SagaGenerator<void> { 	yield* takeEvery( 		[ActivityActions.push, ActivityActions.cancel], 		function* handlePushAction(action) { 			const activity = ActivityActions.push.match(action) 				? action.payload.activity 				: action.payload.replacementActivity;  			if ( 				activity === undefined || 				!isActivityWithCustomModelLoading(activity) || 				modelsAreLoaded() 			) { 				return; 			}  			const documentModel = customDocumentModelLoader(); 			const formModel = customFormModelLoader();  			yield* put( 				ModelActions.setModels({ 					[formModel.header.id]: formModel, 					[documentModel.header.id]: documentModel 				}) 			); 		} 	); } ``` |
```

### Layouts

*Layouts* define how views are visually arranged inside a Region. The following layouts are provided by default:

#### MasterDetail

Arrangement of views side-by-side, where only one or two views are visible at the same time.

Via the VIEW\_ADD directive in the Application Model it is possible to add a constraint for the preferred width of the right view. The view can take from 1 to 11 of the 12 available layout grid slots, leaving the remaining space for another view visible on the left. If only one view is visible, it uses all available space.

For more details, see the [Widget Showcase](https://www.mgm-tp.com/a12.htmlshowcase/#/widgets/layout/master-detail).

#### Dashboard

All views are arranged in tiles which are positioned in rows and columns. Please consult the Widgets documentation for more details.

#### ApplicationFrame

This layout is only intended to be used for the root region of the application. It renders

* a header showing a logo and a title as well as additional header items which can be defined by the project.
* a sidebar showing the views assigned to the region "SIDEBAR"
* a content part showing the views assigned to the region "CONTENT"

##### Header

The application frame contains a header which by default shows the title of the application.
It can be adapted by the following properties:

* `logoURL`: The URL to the image which should be shown as logo.
* `additionalHeaderItems`: Additional header items, defined by a react component and an orientation.

##### Main Menu

The application frame contains the main menu. In order to customize this aspect a custom main menu component can be provided to the application frame via its `mainMenuComponent` property. Additionally, the main menu button, that is rendered in mobile mode, can be customized by using the `ClientWidgetMap`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When customizing generic Widgets like a `Button`, make sure to wrap your custom context as "close to its usage" as possible, since all instances of a Widget rendered by Client will always use the closest parent context. In this example, this would mean that if you were to wrap the whole application with your custom context, every Button rendered by Client would be customized (which is probably not what you want). |

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ``` | ``` import { useContext } from "react";  import { ButtonProps } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/button/main/button.api"; import { ClientWidgetMapContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/ClientWidgetMap.js";  interface PropsType { 	readonly mobileMode: boolean; 	readonly expanded: boolean; 	onMenuItemClick(): void; }  function CustomMainMenuComponent(props: PropsType): JSX.Element { 	return <React.Fragment />; }  function CustomMainMenuButtonComponent(props: ButtonProps): JSX.Element { 	return <React.Fragment />; }  const DefaultClientWidgetMap = useContext(ClientWidgetMapContext);  const widgetMap = { 	...DefaultClientWidgetMap, 	Button: CustomMainMenuButtonComponent };  <ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider value={widgetMap}> 	<FrameViews.ApplicationFrameLayout 		{...layoutProps} 		mainMenuComponent={CustomMainMenuComponent} 	/> </ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider> ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In order to insure correct behavior it is necessary to call `onMenuItemClick` on every menu entry click if a change should occur! |

###### Mobile Navigation

Mobile Navigation is a build-in feature of the `ApplicationFrameLayout` that is active by default. It enhances the user experience on mobile devices by using the available screen space in a more efficient way.

More details are available in [Mobile Navigation](#features-mobile-navigation).

###### MainMenuContext

On a mobile device the main menu is shown as a sliding menu. It can be toggled by the user via touching the "hamburger" button shown in the mobile header.

The `ApplicationFrameLayout` wraps its content into the provider of the `MainMenuContext` in order to allow toggling the menu in a programmatic way. This React context provides props to get and set the current expansion state of the mobile main menu. This way a custom component can use the context anywhere within the application via its Consumer to toggle the mobile main menu.

A use case is a button in the mobile application header which starts a new activity and at the same time closes the mobile menu to prevent that the view of the new activity is hidden from the user.

##### SidebarContext

The ApplicationFrame wraps a React context around the Sidebar region, with which the current state of the sidebar (collapsed or expanded, minimized or maximized) can be retrieved and set.
Please refer to the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/typedoc/index.html) for more information about `FrameViews.SidebarContext`.

##### Layout Settings

The `ApplicationModel` contains the following `ApplicationFrame` settings which can be used to configure the `ApplicationFrame`:

* disableCollapsingSub: Used to hide the button for triggering the collapsing and expanding of the sidebar
* initialSubExpanded: Used to set the initial expansion state of the sidebar.
* initialSubExpandedState: Used to set the initial size of the sidebar.

Please refer to the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/typedoc/index.html) for more information about `ApplicationModel.ApplicationFrame.Settings`.

#### Stack

Views are "stacked" on top of each other, i.e. only the latest view is visible. Useful for modals.

#### Null

All views are rendered without any layout next to each other in the DOM. Use if you want to output all views without any additional markup.

#### Custom Layouts

You can define your own layouts by returning them in a custom `LayoutProvider`. Then you can use them by referencing them in the Application Model.

Use the same approach to define a custom logo, login image, or version. Example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` import type { JSX } from "react";  import { FrameFactories, FrameViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  export const customLayoutProvider: FrameViews.LayoutProvider = name => { 	return name === "ApplicationFrame" 		? { component: CustomAppFrameLayout } 		: FrameFactories.layoutProvider(name); };  function CustomAppFrameLayout(props: FrameViews.ApplicationFrameLayoutProps): JSX.Element { 	return <FrameViews.ApplicationFrameLayout {...props} logoURL="/images/my_logo.svg" />; } ``` |
```

You could even implement a fully custom layout component, laying out the view components as you wish. See the following example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ``` | ``` import type { JSX } from "react";  import type { FrameViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { FrameFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { LayoutGrid } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/layout/layout-grid/main/layout-grid.view.js";  export const customLayoutProvider: FrameViews.LayoutProvider = name => { 	return name === "CustomGridLayout" 		? { component: CustomGridLayout } 		: FrameFactories.layoutProvider(name); };  function CustomGridLayout(props: FrameViews.LayoutProps): JSX.Element { 	const viewComponents = props.views.map(view => ({ 		ViewComponent: props.viewProvider(view.name), 		view 	}));  	return ( 		<LayoutGrid.Grid> 			<LayoutGrid.Row> 				{viewComponents.map(({ ViewComponent, view }, index) => ( 					<ViewComponent key={`${view.name}-${view.activityId}-${index}`} {...view} /> 				))} 			</LayoutGrid.Row> 		</LayoutGrid.Grid> 	); } ``` |
```

#### Progress Indication

Every layout renders a progress indicating React component wrapping each view component. This component is provided by a *Progress Component Provider*.

The default provider can be obtained by using `FrameFactories.createProgressComponentProvider()`. It delivers a `ProgressIndicator` widget showing a progress spinner if the flag "busy" of the default DataHolder of the related activity is true.

If a different behavior is desired, it is always possible to provide your own custom progress component provider.

##### Conditionally Hide Progress Indicator

To conditionally show or hide the progress indicator from inside the view component, set `handleProgressIndicator` on the view component. If this flag is set to `true`, the progress component will be passed to your view component, where you can show or hide it based on your custom condition. Example:

For functional components

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` function ConditionalProgressComponent(props: View): JSX.Element { 	const customCondition = true; 	const ViewContent = <div>COMPLEX VIEW COMPONENT</div>;  	return props.ProgressComponent && customCondition ? ( 		<props.ProgressComponent activityId={props.activityId}>{ViewContent}</props.ProgressComponent> 	) : ( 		ViewContent 	); }  ConditionalProgressComponent.handleProgressIndicator = true; ``` |
```

For class components

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` class ConditionalProgressComponentClass extends Component<View> { 	static handleProgressIndicator = true;  	render(): ReactNode { 		const customCondition = true; 		const ViewContent = <div>COMPLEX VIEW COMPONENT</div>;  		return this.props.ProgressComponent && customCondition ? ( 			<this.props.ProgressComponent activityId={this.props.activityId}> 				{ViewContent} 			</this.props.ProgressComponent> 		) : ( 			ViewContent 		); 	} } ``` |
```

Here, the view component provider will set `handleProgressIndicator` only for the `ConditionalProgress` components, while keeping the default behavior for all other components.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | In order to achieve this behavior when using your own custom layout, you need check for this flag and either wrap your ViewComponent inside of the ProgressComponent (if `false` or not set) or pass it to the ViewComponent as the prop `ProgressComponent` |

#### Error Boundaries

Every layout renders an error boundary component wrapping each view component. Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

The error boundary component is provided by an *Error Boundary Provider*.
The default provider `FrameFactories.errorBoundaryProvider` delivers an `ErrorBoundary` with a default fallback component. This fallback shows a component with detailed information about the error and a button to cancel the current activity.

The provider mechanism allows to replace the default error boundary component for specific views or regions, e.g.:

Using a custom error boundary provider

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export function MainComponent(): JSX.Element { 	const RegionUi = FrameFactories.regionUiProvider([]);  	// other props here... 	const regionUiProps = {} as FrameViews.RegionUiProps;  	return <RegionUi {...regionUiProps} errorBoundaryProvider={CustomErrorBoundaryProvider} />; } ``` |
```

To prevent re-renderings of your view components, it is essential that your provider always returns a stable function reference like this:

Using a custom error boundary

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 ``` | ``` import type { ComponentType, JSX } from "react"; import { Component } from "react";  import type { FrameViews, ApplicationModel, View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { FrameFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  class SpecificErrorBoundary extends Component<View.ErrorBoundaryProvider.PropsType> { 	state = { 		error: null 	};  	componentDidCatch(error: Error): void { 		this.setState({ error }); 	}  	render() { 		const { error } = this.state; 		if (error !== null) { 			return <div>Specific error text for ProductView</div>; 		}  		return this.props.children; 	} }  function CustomErrorBoundaryProvider( 	regionReference: ApplicationModel.Region.Reference, 	viewName: string ): ComponentType<View.ErrorBoundaryProvider.PropsType> { 	const DefaultErrorBoundary = FrameFactories.errorBoundaryProvider();  	return viewName === "ProductView" ? SpecificErrorBoundary : DefaultErrorBoundary; } ``` |
```

Here, the custom error boundary rendering a fallback text is used only for a specific ViewComponent. In all other cases, the default error boundary is used.
Because the error boundary is defined outside of the provider, its reference will not change during reacts lifecycle.

#### Resizing

It is possible to enable resizing for the following built-in layouts via customization:

* ApplicationFrameLayout: horizontal resizing of the sidebar
* MasterDetailRegionLayout: horizontal resizing of the left view

The customization is enabled via the widget map approach:

The Client layout components allow optionally providing alternative layout widget components via a widget map.
The provided custom widgets can be setup to be resizable using the resizing api of the respective layout widget. Please consult the Widgets documentation for more details.

The following example shows how to achieve this in a Client based application. A custom layout name is defined in the Application Model. A custom layout provider returns a custom layout component for that name. In this component, the widgetMap property is defined and provides a respective custom, resize-enabled layout widget.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 ``` | ``` import { useContext, type JSX } from "react";  import { 	ClientWidgetMapContext, 	FrameFactories, 	FrameViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import type { 	MasterDetailProps, 	VisibleView } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/layout/master-detail/main/master-detail.api.js"; import { MasterDetail } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/layout/master-detail/main/master-detail.view.js";  export const customLayoutProvider: FrameViews.LayoutProvider = name => { 	return name === "MyResizableMasterDetailLayout" 		? { component: CustomResizableMasterDetailLayout } 		: FrameFactories.layoutProvider(name); };  const resizeOptions: VisibleView["resizableOptions"] = { 	minWidth: 200, 	maxWidth: "75%" };  function ResizableMasterDetail(props: MasterDetailProps): JSX.Element { 	return <MasterDetail {...props} firstViewResizableOptions={resizeOptions} />; }  export function CustomResizableMasterDetailLayout( 	props: FrameViews.MasterDetailLayoutProps ): JSX.Element { 	const DefaultClientWidgetMap = useContext(ClientWidgetMapContext);  	const customWidgetMap = { 		...DefaultClientWidgetMap, 		MasterDetail: ResizableMasterDetail 	};  	return ( 		<ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider value={customWidgetMap}> 			<FrameViews.MasterDetailRegionLayout {...props} /> 		</ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider> 	); } ``` |
```

### ClientWidgetMap

The `ClientWidgetMap` can be used to customize the Widgets that are rendered by A12 Client itself. Client internally uses a default variant of this map, but you can provide your own implementation containing your customizations via React Context. Then it will be used in place of the default one.

For example, customizing the way the `MasterDetailRegionLayout` component renders its `MasterDetail` Widget can look like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ``` | ``` import type { JSX } from "react"; import { useContext } from "react";  import { ClientWidgetMapContext, FrameViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import type { MasterDetailProps } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/layout/master-detail/main/master-detail.api.js"; import { MasterDetail } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/layout/master-detail/main/master-detail.view.js";  function CustomMasterDetail(props: MasterDetailProps): JSX.Element { 	return <MasterDetail {...props} /* customization here*/ />; }  export function CustomResizableMasterDetailLayout( 	props: FrameViews.MasterDetailLayoutProps ): JSX.Element { 	const DefaultClientWidgetMap = useContext(ClientWidgetMapContext);  	const customWidgetMap = { 		...DefaultClientWidgetMap, 		MasterDetail: CustomMasterDetail 	}; 	return ( 		<ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider value={customWidgetMap}> 			<FrameViews.MasterDetailRegionLayout {...props} /> 		</ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider> 	); } ``` |
```

Here, we first get the default Widget implementation from the context and then add our own customization, specifically for the `MasterDetail` Widget.

Note that this map will only customize A12 Widgets rendered by Client **itself**, not the ones rendered by your application (e.g. your own view components).

### Localization

Localization in A12 is done by using the `Localizer`, which is accessible from a `LocalizerContext` react context.
This react context has to wrap all the react components of the Client application that need to localize any texts.
The Client library does not create this context itself. The application code has to add it to the react component tree itself.
It is suggested to add this context as one of the outermost react components of the application.

#### Current Locale

The current locale is part of the application state and as such managed in the Redux store.
Defining an initial locale of the application is done by dispatching the `LocaleActions.set` action with the wanted
locale during the setup phase. This can be achieved by adding this action to `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup`.

#### Available Locales

A12 Client provides a ready-to-use component `LocaleSelect` to update the locale. The available locales need to be set as a property on that component.
Note that an initial locale set via application setup also needs to be part of that list.

#### Localizer

The localizer is defined by the A12 localization API and represents the core of it. Please refer the documentation of the
`@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization` library for more in-depth information.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` export interface Localizer { 	(...localizable: Localizable[]): string | undefined; } ``` |
```

All A12-related localizations are covered by the default texts that the `Localizable` objects can contain. I.e. any localizable
that is created by A12-internal logic will always bring the default translations for the English and German locale.
Additional texts to override or extend the A12-default texts can be passed to e.g. the `defaultLocalizerFactory` when creating
an application-specific `Localizer` function.
Please refer to documentation of the `@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-localization` library for more details on how this can be achieved.

#### Localization Keys

The main identification aspect of localizables are the localization keys. Every `Localizable` that is provided to a localizer
must have a localization key!
How the different localization keys are generated depends on their producer. Therefore, it may be necessary to read the
documentation of other components like Form Engine and Overview Engine.

##### Static Resources

For static resources the keys are provided by the constant `LOCALE_RESOURCE_KEYS` which is located in `core/locale`. This
constant provides the keys as well as the documentation of their usage.
For extensions similar constants exist and are provided by the extensions. Please consult the documentation of the extensions
for more details.

##### Application Model

Please note that you can also provide localization texts directly in the Application Model. Every entry is localizable by
providing different texts in a map. The key is hereby the string representation of the `Locale` object.

###### Menu Entries

The key of each menu entry has the pattern
`application-model.{application-model-name}.{module-name}.{menu-name}\(.{sub-menu-name})`\* .

###### Cases

The key of each case has the pattern
`application-model.{application-model-name}.{module-name}.{flow-name}.{scene-name}.{case-name}`.

#### Single Locale Setup

In order to setup the Client with a single locale that is not the default `en_US`, you have to set the
[current locale](#/advanced/localization/current-locale) in the Redux store to the desired locale, e.g. `fr_FR`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Client only provides default texts and configurations for `en` and `de`. For every other locale it is necessary to provide the necessary texts and configurations. This can be achieved by providing the texts in the models (form, overview, document, and application) or by using the [A12 localization API](#/advanced/localization/localizer). |

#### Hidden Accessibility Texts

For the localization of hidden accessibility texts, we rely on the Widgets. In order to provide your custom localization
you have to use the `A11YLanguageContext` component, which is provided by Widgets. This component should be used next to the `Provider` component from React-Redux. Please see the accessibility section in the Widgets documentation for more details.

### Modularization

The ModuleRegistry is an API to enable modularization of Client projects. The API offers extension points to implement dynamic modules in the Client Redux context. This documentation shows what a modularized Client project can look like.

#### Motivation

Modularization is a common requirement in web projects regarding different aspects:

* Architecture

  + Clear dependency management
  + Clear relation between frontend and backend code
  + Loose coupling of BE modules
  + API for portal / cross-functionality
* Infrastructure

  + Possibility to separately release a module (not by default)
  + Possibility to separately deploy a module (not by default)
* Organization

  + Modules can be developed by another supplier
  + Modules can be easily switched off or de-activated

Different but related aspects are:

* Keep JS modules in the browser cache for offline usage
* Partial loading of modules - modules which are not used are not loaded
* Delta updates in production in order to limit bandwidth

#### ModuleRegistry

To be able to build up a single page Client application by modules dynamically, the base or core application itself is not allowed to know the concrete modules. The modules have to register themselves to any part of the architecture they want to participate in.

Therefore, the Client architecture provides a central `ModuleRegistry` to add, remove or retrieve modules. More information about the API can be found in the respective part of the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/typedoc/index.html).

To implement a module the API offers different extension points like reducers, views, sagas, etc. The Client uses the OSGi whiteboard pattern to integrate the modules: The extension points use a provider to ask all the modules for specific functions. To enable dynamic implementations of these interfaces, access to the Redux state is needed.

Modules have to return an unique id. Everything else is optional.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Module definitions should not interfere and interact with each other to prevent any execution order issue because the execution order is not ensured. This especially applies to fallback solutions for DataProviders, DataEditors and DataReducers because they prevent the executions of others that are later in the execution chain. Therefore, it is highly recommended that every fallback logic for preventing fatal error should be done in the global definition. |

The `ModuleRegistry` can be accessed by the `ModuleRegistryProvider` namespace.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` export namespace ModuleRegistryProvider { 	export function getInstance(): ModuleRegistry { 		// ...  	}  	export function getViewProvider(state: object, fallback: View.Provider): View.Provider { 		// ...  	} } ``` |
```

The `ModuleRegistryProvider` also offers the `getViewProvider` function which can be used in a `RegionUi` to set the `viewProvider` as this an extension point outside the Client core.

#### Using the API

To register a module we first need to implement the `Module` interface

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ``` | ``` export const myModule: Module = { 	id: "my-module",  	model(state: object): ApplicationModel { 		return myModuleAppModel; 	},  	views(state: object): (componentName: string) => ComponentType<View> | undefined { 		return MyModuleFactories.createRenderer; 	},  	middlewares(store: object): Middleware[] { 		return [MyModuleFactories.createCRUDMiddleware()]; 	},  	reducersMap(state: object): ReducerMap { 		return { 			slice1: MyModuleReducers1.slice1, 			slice2: combineReducers({ 				slice2_1: MyModuleReducers2.slice2_1 				// ... 			}) 		}; 	},  	sagas(state: object): (() => SagaIterator<void>)[] { 		return []; 	} }; ``` |
```

Then the module can be registered before or after bootstrapping the Client Application by `ApplicationSetup`.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ``` | ``` // Load the moduleAppModel before ModuleRegistryProvider.getInstance().addModule(myModule);  const model: ApplicationModel = { 	header: { 		id: "base-application-model", 		locales: [{ code: "en" }], 		modelType: "application", 		modelVersion: "4.0.0" 	}, 	content: { 		region: { 			name: "APP", 			layout: { name: "ApplicationFrame" }, 			subRegions: [{ name: "CONTENT", layout: { name: "MasterDetail" } }] 		}, 		defaultRegion: ["CONTENT"], 		modules: [ 			/* Add your flows and scenes here */ 		] 	} };  export const config: ApplicationSetup = ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ 	model, 	modelLoader: emptyModelLoader, 	dataHandlers: emptyDataHub, 	additionalMiddlewares: [] }); ``` |
```

As you can see we still need to define the Application Model, the modules model will be added at runtime. Special care must be taken when removing modules at runtime and it should be avoided, if possible. If there is an active View in a module, removing the module will lead to an Error.

If you remove a module at runtime you are responsible for consistency. For example you may have to stop running sagas or middleware that are doing processing in the background, or you have to remove state from the store.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Modules are not allowed to set own reducers for the following slices because they are handled internally:  * activities * locale * models * application * notifications |

#### Implementing Custom Extension Points

The given extension points may not fit your needs completely, but with the API it is quite simple to implement new ones on top of it.

In the example we see a `MyAbstractModule` which is the base class for every project module that offers the new extension `getModuleSpecificRenderer`.
The `MyModuleExtensions.getRenderer()` function provides a renderer to render a central component that includes module specific parts:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ``` | ``` export abstract class MyAbstractModule implements Module { 	id = "myAbstractModule";  	// ...  	moduleSpecificRenderer(): (props: ModuleSpecificProps) => JSX.Element | undefined { 		return props => undefined; 	} }  export namespace MyModuleExtensions { 	export function getRenderer(): (props: ModuleSpecificProps) => JSX.Element { 		return props => { 			for (const module of ModuleRegistryProvider.getInstance().getAllModules()) { 				if (module instanceof MyAbstractModule) { 					const result = module.moduleSpecificRenderer()(props); 					if (result) { 						return result; 					} 				} 			} 			return <div>{/* ... default View */}</div>; 		}; 	} } ``` |
```

#### Modules and the Main Menu

The default main menu of the Client creates one menu item per (Application Model) menu, and the order of the menu items is the same as the appearance / order of registration in the Application Model.
When using Modularization, this might not fit your needs. In this case, please integrate a custom menu component using the App Frame’s mainMenuComponent API.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When using the adapter module with multiple Application Models (see below), the menu order is dependent on the order of the models in the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph). |

#### Adapter Module

Client provides an Adapter Module to handle multiple Application Models. This module can be registered like any other Client module and will collect all Application Models in your model graph, load them and make them available.
When using the adapter module, specifying an Application Model in your application setup becomes obsolete (because Application Models from the Model Graph will be collected anyway). Since the typing still requires you to set the property, Client provides a placeholder that can be used in that case. Please see the snippet below for an example.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ``` | ``` import { 	AppModelAdapterModule, 	ApplicationFactories, 	ModuleRegistryProvider, 	APPLICATION_MODEL_PLACEHOLDER } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core"; import { createPlatformServerModelLoader } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/modelLoader";  // register the adapter module like other Client modules ModuleRegistryProvider.getInstance().addModule(AppModelAdapterModule);  ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ 	// this placeholder is just a completely empty application model 	model: APPLICATION_MODEL_PLACEHOLDER, 	modelLoader: createPlatformServerModelLoader(), 	dataHandlers: [], 	additionalMiddlewares: [] });  // NOTE: do not forget to setup up your modelGraph ``` |
```

Note that while the adapter allows to provide multiple Application Models, in most use cases a single Application Model should be sufficient.
In this case you can still specify it in the setup directly. Changing an existing setup by splitting the Application Model into multiple ones is not recommended and might lead to unwanted effects (see below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Using this adapter module requires a Model Graph that contains all Application Models you want to load. See the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) and the A12 Services documentation for more information about it. |

##### Merging Application Models

When matching scenes, Client will internally consider all Application Models that were loaded this way and merge them together into one.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When merging regions of Application Models, only the subregions are taken into account. If a Region (identified by name) exists both in source and target model, the subregions of source are added, while all other properties from the source are ignored. |

##### Effects of Having Multiple Application Models

* Having more than one Application Model with an initial activity is not supported and will lead to unexpected results. There should always only be a single initial activity.
* When multiple Application Models contribute menu entries, their order is defined by the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) (as this is used to find and load the models from the server).

### Dirty Handling

This extension consists of a Dirty Handling saga and a VetoDialog, which can be wrapped around the application.

The saga can be used instead of the default cancelRequestedHandling saga, to handle the CANCEL\_REQUESTED action.

The CANCEL\_REQUESTED action contains in its payload an array of activity ids and will cancel these activities if they are not dirty or locked.
For evaluating the dirty state the saga takes all DataHolders of the activity into account. An activity is dirty if one of the DataHolders is dirty.

If an activity is dirty or locked, a SET\_CANCEL\_CONFIRMATION\_REQUIRED action with cancelConfirmationRequired=true is dispatched. The saga then waits until a RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_CONFIRMATION action is dispatched. This action contains in its payload the information about if there was a veto for the cancellation. If there was no veto the activity gets cancelled by the dirty handling saga. If there was a veto the activity does not get cancelled and the whole cancelling process gets aborted.

If all activities got cancelled the Dirty Handling saga dispatches in the end the RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_REQUESTED action which contains the payload "cancelled=true". If not all activities got cancelled, because there was a veto, the saga dispatches the RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_REQUESTED action which contains the payload "cancelled=false". The caller can use the ActivitySaga `waitForResponseCancelRequested` to wait for the response of the cancelProcess.

Example usage:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` const activityIdsWhichShouldBeCancelled = ["A", "B"];  yield put(ActivityActions.cancelRequested({activityIds: activityIdsWhichShouldBeCancelled }));  // wait for the process to finish and take the response const cancelled: boolean = yield call(ActivitySagas.waitForResponseCancelRequested);  if(cancelled){ 	// all activities where cancelled } else { 	// not all activities where cancelled } ``` |
```

If the VetoDialog is used, it will listen to any state change and show a dialog, if there is an activity with "cancelConfirmationRequired=true" . The dialog offers two options: "Discard changes" and "Abort".

* The first option dispatches a RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_CONFIRMATION action with veto=false.
* The second option dispatches a RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_CONFIRMATION action with veto=true.

If you do not use the VetoDialog, you have to take care of dispatching a RESPONSE\_CANCEL\_CONFIRMATION action, if there are activities which need a cancelConfirmation, yourself.

### Notifications

The `core/notification` API can be used to notify the user about arbitrary events.

In order to visualize notifications, it is mandatory to wrap the application’s root component with a suitable React component to visualize notifications. The `core/notification` API provides a default frame component. Without such a component no notification is shown to the user.

Notifications can be created by dispatching the notification action "add" and removed again by the corresponding "remove" action.

Notifications can be bound to activities by providing the corresponding activity id to the notification. Activity bounded notifications will be removed automatically if the bounded activity is removed by either committing or canceling. If no activity id is provided then the notification is treated as a global notification and will not be removed on removing any activity.

Currently, notifications by default are shown as toast messages following the function and design of the A12 Toast Widget. They can be customized in their message, position, duration, color, and other options via the properties of the notification object, that needs to be given to the "add" action as payload.

It is also possible to create completely custom notifications by providing the notification frame with a notification renderer, that would return the custom notification view.

#### Mobile

On mobile the position is not customizable due to the small available space. Therefore, only the newest notification is shown on the bottom of the screen.

### Deep Linking

The deep linking extension helps to implement URL based (activity) state restoration, e.g. when a user wants to share a deep link into the application. Whenever a (relevant) state changes, the encoder is called to update the location part of the URL. When loading the application, the decoder is called to restore activity state based on the URL location.

To register this extension you need to call `DeepLinkingFactories.createSagas` and pass the returned sagas to the `customSagas` property of the `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup` function.

#### Default Codec

The extension includes a default codec, that uses the descriptor of the latest activity. This means that other state of the activity or even other activities will not be recovered, so the scene might not look the same as at the time of encoding.

#### Setup

##### URL Encoding

Registering the sagas is already enough to activate the encoding of the last started activity into the URL with the default codec.

##### Activity Restoration

To restore the activity encoded in the URL when the app is loading, you need to setup an action which serves as a trigger for the restoration to be started.

First, you have to dispatch this action after the initialization code of the app was executed. This could be e.g. before the first render of the app or after the user logged in successfully.

Second, the action also needs to be added to the array of apply triggers in the deep linking sagas configuration. You can hand in the configuration object to the `DeepLinkingFactories.createSagas` factory function in your app setup.

#### Configuration

To further customize this extension you can pass more options to the `DeepLinkingFactories.createSagas` function via the configuration object.
This configuration contains:

* **updateTriggers**: A list of actions for which the deep link should be updated
* **applyTriggers**: A list of actions for which the deep link should be applied

  If no action is given in `applyTriggers` the deep link will never be applied. If the `Activity` encoded in the URL is not found, the default page will be loaded if configured (see [Welcome Page](#/features/deep-linking/welcome-page)).
* **clearTriggers**: A list of action for which the deep link should be cleared
* **loadingTimeout**: The time that is waited for the data of a data source activity to be loaded. When it expires and the data is not loaded, the to-be-restored activity will not be created.

#### Customization

There are other properties in the configuration object which can be used to replace default implementations:

* **deepLinkCoder**: Users can provide their own implementation of `DeepLinkCoder`, which decides, what information is encoded in the URL, and how this is done. The default implementation only uses information stored in the `ActivityDescriptor`.
* **locationManager**: A custom location manager can be provided which allows customizing the handling of the location part of the url. The default implementation only manages setting the '#' character before the location part.

#### Limitations

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This feature is not meant to provide full URL-based navigation through the application (Routing). |

By default, only the latest Activity is restored, regardless of how many Activities were active
when the link was created.

Additionally, the URL changes are not saved in the browser history and therefore it is not possible to navigate to a previous or later Activity with the browser navigation buttons.

If you want to encode more Activities or even implement a history-based navigation yourself, a good custom implementation can be found in
[Discourse](https://discourse.geta12.com/t/implementing-a-router-for-bap-client/272/3).

It is not sufficient to just change the link in the address bar of a web browser. The link needs to be opened.

Deep links currently do not work when used in combination with the priorScene property of Scenes (see [Arrange UIs](#/basics/views/arranging-uis)).

#### Welcome Page

To set a default starting page ("welcome page"), you need to set the property `initialActivity` in your Application Model. This contains the descriptor of the activity that will open as your starting/welcome activity. Additionally, you need to configure at least one action which indicates that this activity should be loaded.
To do that, you have two possibilities:

If you already configured the deep-linking extension as described above, the saga that listens to `applyTriggers` will load the activity described by the `initialActivity` property of your App Model, when one of these actions gets dispatched and when the current url does not contain a deep link.

If the App Model does not contain an `initialActivity` property and the current url does not contain a deep link, the saga will do nothing.

If you don’t want to use the deep-linking functionality, you need to call `DeepLinkingFactories.loadWelcomePage` and pass its returned saga to the `customSagas` property of the `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup` function. Then you need to configure it by adding your action/actions to the `applyTriggers` list, in the same way as described above.

The saga from `DeepLinkingFactories.loadWelcomePage` will listen for your configured actions and create the activity described by the `initialActivity` property of your App Model.

If no `initialActivity` is set in the App Model, the saga will do nothing.

Finally, to actually show the view component of your welcome page, you need to define a scene in your Application Model matching the descriptor of the `initialActivity` with its match conditions and which has a VIEW\_ADD directive with your welcome page view.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When using the default `ModelLoader` implementation of Client and your initial activity wants to load models, make sure to use a trigger action that is dispatched **after** the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) was set. Since by default Client [uses the Model Graph to resolve model dependencies](#/advanced/model-loading), triggering model loading before the graph exists will fail. |

##### Modularization

If no `initialActivity` is set in the root App Model and you add Application Models using the `ModelActions.addModulesApplicationModels` action then the initial activity is taken from the first App Model defining one which is merged into the root App Model.

### Model Graph

The Model Graph provides information about Models during runtime.

The following Client features make use of the Model Graph and therefore require you to load and set it:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Feature | Reason |
| [Heterogeneity](#/features/heterogeneity) | lookup of supertype relations |
| [Model loading](#/advanced/model-loading) (when using the default `ModelLoader` implementation provided by Client.[[4](#_footnotedef_4 "View footnote.")]) | resolving model references |

You can load the Model Graph yourself from any place, but most probably you want to use the respective A12 Services API to load it from an A12 Server. A simple and safe occasion is immediately after the user logged in. Please refer to [the Services documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/data_services/dataservices-documentation-src/index.html#rest_get_model_graph) for more information.

You can set the Model Graph using `ModelActions.setModelGraph`, e.g. like this:

How to set a ModelGraph

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` // create your appsetup const config = ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup({ 	model: model as ApplicationModel, 	modelLoader: createPlatformServerModelLoader(), 	dataHandlers: [] });  // ...later (e.g. after a user logged in) configureModelGraph(config);  async function configureModelGraph(config: ApplicationSetup) { 	// assuming a configured server connector 	const serverConnector = 		ConnectorLocator.getInstance().getServerConnector() as RestServerConnector;  	// fetch the graph in some way 	const modelGraph = await serverConnector.fetchData(ModelGraph.build(true)).then(r => r.json());  	// set it into state 	config.store.dispatch(ModelActions.setModelGraph(modelGraph)); } ``` |
```

Until you set the Model Graph, an empty Model Graph will be assumed.

### Heterogeneity

Heterogeneity is an experimental feature in A12 that allows the handling of sets of Documents of different types.

First, the involved parts are described. Then it is shown how to create a setup using the commerce sample domain.

In the following, the terms *Type* and *Document Model* are used synonymously. However, they serve different purposes. *Document Model* is the well-known way in which the inner structure of Documents are defined. *Type* is a new way to describe Dependencies between entities without caring about their inner structure. Types "live" inside the Model Graph.

#### Subtype Dependency

The Subtype Dependency declares an "is a" relationship from one Document Model to another. The intention is to instantiate and process Documents which have an "is a" relationship in a uniform way.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The Subtype Dependency only declares the relationship. It does **not** imply or even require inheritance of fields/groups/rules. If your business logic requires inheritance, then you have to ensure it yourself, e.g. by using includes or copying fields/groups/rules. |

You declare a Subtype Dependency by adding an Annotation with name `subTypes` to the metadata section of the supertype. The value of the Annotation is a comma separated list of the names of the subtypes.

The following concepts are **not** implemented in the current version:

* Multiple Inheritance
* Metadata on subtypes (e.g. to filter subtypes)

#### Model Graph Loading

With the introduction of heterogeneity, every Client holds a Model Graph inside its state.

To use heterogeneity, you must load and set the Model Graph. See the [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) documentation for an example.

#### Heterogeneous Overviews

To list a heterogeneous set of Documents, you can assign the common super type as the Document Model of the Overview Model. The A12 Server will then take all Documents of that super type and all sub types into account.

#### Creating New Documents

In heterogeneous overview, newly created Documents can be of different types.

The CRUD extension detects that the type associated with the Overview Model has sub types. It then displays a dialog to select the type of the new Document. The offered types are the same as those used for heterogeneous overviews.

#### Document Model-Dependent Forms

When editing a Document from a heterogeneous set, you probably want to define a single Application Model Scene, but still use different forms for Documents of different types.

In order to achieve this, you need to limit the usage of a Form Model to a specific Document type. This can be done by adding a Document Model constraint to the referenced Form Model in the respective Scene of the Application Model.

Limitations:

* For each Document type, you must provide a Form Model entry, except if all Document types should share the same Form Model - then you must only provide exactly one Form Model without Document Model.
* All declared Form Models are loaded on the first usage of the Scene. This can be slow the first time if you have many Sub Types.

#### Example Setup (Simple CRUD)

The following section describes the necessary changes to make use of heterogeneity in the A12 sample domain "commerce". You can find the full, working setup in the Relationships example of the Client DevApp.

It is a simple setup that makes use of the CRUD component, which contains
pre-configured versions of the heterogeneity building blocks.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can find all models in the source code of the Client DevApp in the folder `core/resources/models/`. |

##### Modeling

* In the Document Model `DomainProduct`, set `DomainBundle` as subtype.
* Setup a Scene using the Overview Model `Product-overview` and the view `OverviewCRUD`.
* Setup a Scene using the Form Models `Product` and `Brand` (constrained to the respective type) and the view `RelationshipFormEngine`.

##### Application Setup

* Set the Model Graph. See [Model Graph](#/features/modelgraph) documentation on how to do it.

#### Example Setup (Detailed)

In order to tailor the heterogeneity functionality to project specific needs,
you can combine the provided building blocks, or replace them with your own implementation.

All modeling in Document or Application Models is done exactly in the same way as described in the CRUD example above. Therefore, here, only the coding API is explained.

The currently available building blocks are:

* Variant selection mapper: a function that maps given types to a tree of selection options
* Variant selection UI: a component to render an UI to select a type for given selection options

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can find the fully working example in the source code of the Client DevApp in the folder `core/src/devApp/src/modules/data_handling/heterogeneity` of the Client repository. |

##### Variant Selection Mapper

The provided default variant selection mapper is a function that accepts a single root type and creates a tree of selection options from it.

The root type defines, which part of the type hierarchy you want to render.

The resulting tree defines the available options, if they are abstract or concrete, as well as their nesting, order, and labels.

You can pass the result of the mapping to the default variant selection React component to render a selection UI.

The provided callback of the default selection UI will be invoked with the name of the selected type, which can then be used to e.g. start a new Activity.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | When starting a new Activity for a heterogeneous Scene containing Engines, make sure to set the *model* property in the Descriptor. The Client needs it to pick the right engine models. |

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` const localizer = useContext(LocalizerContext).localizer;  const myStartingType = modelGraph.documentModels.find(dm => dm.modelId === "MyModel");  if (!myStartingType) { 	throw new Error("Model graph incomplete!"); }  const options = defaultVariantSelectionMapper(modelGraph, localizer)(myStartingType);  return <VariantSelection variants={options} onSelect={handleSelection} />; ``` |
```

In order to change the enablement, nesting, order or labels of types, you can replace/compose the default mapper.

In order to change the rendering, you can replace/compose the default React component.

### Accessibility Support

The Client allows creating applications with accessibility support.

To make the application accessible for a user who uses accessibility tools like a screen reader, the application requires a clear hierarchical structure which also is reflected in the application’s HTML.

The user interface of a Client application is structured using regions which are configured with layouts to display views and other UI components like menus and headers.

The hierarchical structure within the UI and the underlying HTML is established by using unambiguous HTML tags like nav for navigation components and by providing ARIA levels and the role "heading" to the headings and specific roles to other building blocks of those UI components.

#### ARIA in Built-in Layouts

##### ApplicationFrameLayout

The ApplicationFrameLayout is typically used in the application’s root region to give the application its base structure. It provides an application header and a main menu and it allows to orchestrate the content for a main content region, a sidebar region, and a modal region.

The following aria configuration is applied:

* the application header has the role "banner"
* the main menu is build with a nav-tag as root HTML element, marking it as a navigation for a screen reader
* the main content view has the role "main", marking it as the application’s main content
* the side bar usually contains project specific custom content, making it a project responsibility to define an appropriate aria structure using nav-tags for a navigation, aria-levels for headings and suitable aria roles.

  When the case feature of the Client is used and a navigation to the different cases is displayed in the side bar, a nav-tag is used.
* The modal region content again requires project specific configuration.

##### DashboardLayout

The DashboardLayout renders its views as tiles in a grid.

The aria structure is established by

* rendering a hidden title with aria-level 1 and role "heading" above the tiles
* handing aria-level 2 to the views in the tiles, so that the views can use this level for their headings.

##### MasterDetailLayout

The MasterDetailLayout allows rendering a list of views, with each view depending on the previous one which creates a hierarchy of views.

Therefore it hands aria-levels in ascending order starting with 1 to its visible views, so that the headings of these views can reflect that hierarchy.

##### StackRegionLayout

The StackRegionLayout can manage a list of views but will always only render the last added one. This view will receive aria-level 1 for its heading.

#### ARIA in Built-in Components

##### Engines

The Engines provide views which render a ContentBox Widget with a title. The title should be set for good accessibility. It can be defined in the respective UI model. The title will receive the aria-level determined for the view by the layout.

Further details about accessibility support of the Engines can be found in the respective engine documentation.

##### ErrorBoundary

When an error is thrown during rendering of a view, the built-in layouts render the fallback component of the provided ErrorBoundary. It receives the same aria-level as the view, so that it can be set to the fallback component’s title.

#### ARIA in Custom Layouts and Views

When you are creating custom layouts and views and have to fulfill the requirement of good accessibility, we have the following recommendations:

##### Custom Layouts

* The layout should hand aria-levels to its visible views which resemble the hierarchy in which these views stand to each other. Views having the same level in the application hierarchy should get the same aria-level. A view depending on a parent view should get a higher aria-level than that of the parent.
* If the layout wraps its views in ErrorBoundary components, those should get the same aria-level as the wrapped view.

##### Custom Views

* The HTML tag of the view’s heading component should have the aria-level which was handed to the view, and the role "heading". This way the heading will integrate into the application’s aria heading hierarchy.
* For a good accessibility structure make sure your custom view has a heading. If you want to make the heading invisible but still accessible for screen readers, you can use the plasma style helper class "-u-unseenButRead" or style your header accordingly.
* Please do not use aria-level for sub headings inside the view. Only the view’s top heading, e.g. the content box title, should have an aria-level.
* To structure the content of your view use roles on the HTML containers, e.g. "form" for content with input fields, "document" for text, "heading" for sub headings. Nesting such containers with roles makes the structure transparent for screen readers.
* Please do not use h-tags for sub headings, since this interferes with the hierarchy created by the aria-levels. Instead use styled div tags with the role "heading".
* Use a nav-tag as root tag for navigation components or use the role "navigation".

#### Focus Handling Between Views

In some situations you might want to change the focus from one view to another. For example, this could happen when adding or removing views in a layout.
How to achieve this focus behavior depends on the concrete requirement and the specific project setup.
The Client DevApp provides an example in the "Examples" section demonstrating a custom focus handling between an overview and a form.

### Asynchronous Flows With Redux Saga

Client uses the JavaScript library Redux Saga for code that involves asynchronous execution and side effects. This code can be often seen as defining application flow of some type, like logging-in and -out of a user or retrieving documents from a server and storing them in the redux store. Redux Saga allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, by using generator functions, called in this context "sagas", that yield descriptions of what "effects" should occur at any given point in the flow. Those descriptions are then handled by the saga middleware to perform tasks, like dispatching actions, waiting for some action to come, calling an asynchronous function (a function that returns a promise). Effects can be blocking or non-blocking.

Most sagas use the take-effect (or the helper effects takeLatest or takeEvery) to wait for an action that matches some pattern. It is important to remember, that the saga middleware executes after reducers - if some reducer changes the store in some way on receiving an action, and some saga listens for the same action, then by the time yield take returns, the store was already modified by the reducer. If this is not desired, then a new type of action should be created, that is ignored by reducers.

For general information about Redux Saga, you may want to visit following links:

* [Redux project page](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* [Tutorial with background information](https://www.blog.duomly.com/implement-redux-saga-with-reactjs-and-redux/#redux-saga)
* [Comparison of Thunks and Sagas with background information and links to discussions](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/01/idiomatic-redux-thoughts-on-thunks-sagas-abstraction-and-reusability/)
* [Description of an approach that strictly divides actions into signals (that trigger sagas) and deltas (that trigger reducers)](https://medium.com/@totaldis/redux-saga-in-action-s-f7d11cffa35a)

#### Implementation of Sagas in Client

In the standard case, like the one described in the official tutorial (to be found under the first link above), a saga is a generator function that is directly connected to the saga middleware. It has all the freedoms allowed by Redux-Saga and behaves as if it was a separate thread. It is completely independent of any other sagas. Client allows to define sagas like this, but the built-in platform-sagas are implemented in a different way.

##### Connecting Sagas Directly to Middleware

Custom sagas can be passed in the customSagas-argument to the factory function `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup`. Its platform implementation passes each saga to the run-function defined by the saga middleware. This function executes each saga right away, so if it contained some blocking code, it would freeze the application. That’s why possibly long running code should always be run asynchronous and the sagas should always yield effects. Typical usage is that a saga waits for some action using the take-effect and then calls some asynchronous code using the call-effect.

##### Connecting Sagas to the Dispatcher

This method is used for built-in platform-sagas and it allows to overwrite them. Objects implementing the interface `ApplicationSaga.Descriptor` can be passed in the overridePlatformSagas-argument to the factory function `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup`. A descriptor must define following two functions:

* canHandle: takes an action as argument and returns true, if the saga should execute
* handle: calls a generator function (can be seen as a saga), that handles the action matched by canHandle and returns its result, that is, a generator

To use the Descriptor, you need following import:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` import { ApplicationSaga } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/application"; ``` |
```

Those descriptors are then used by the dispatcher, a saga that is directly connected to the middleware, just like in the standard case described before. The dispatcher receives all actions dispatched to the store and calls canHandle on every descriptor that it knows. For the first matching descriptor, the dispatcher yields the generator returned by its handle-function, that is then processed by the saga middleware. To recapitulate, the dispatcher dispatches actions to functions, that can handle them.

This mechanism can be used to selectively overwrite built-in sagas - all descriptors in overridePlatformSagas are checked before built-in sagas, so if some of them can handle the same action as some built-in saga, then it will be executed instead.

This mechanism has its restrictions - some concurrency patterns, that are possible when using sagas in a standard way, are currently not directly possible, like takeLatest or blocking take. The dispatcher uses takeEvery under the hood, so an action is always executed, if any of the registered descriptors can handle it.

For an explanation of takeEvery and takeLatest you may want to visit the [documentation](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/basics/UsingSagaHelpers.html) on Redux Saga helpers.

##### Providing Own Dispatcher

Users of Client can pass the setup function their own implementation of the dispatcher. It is then executed by the saga middleware, just like provided dispatcher would be, and receives all registered descriptors as argument.

#### Error Handling in Sagas

The circumstance that sagas are implemented as generator functions allows for easy error handling with the try…catch statement. Inside the catch-block, the ERROR-action should be created, that is then used by reducers to save the error and error status in the affected activity. Below are the steps, that comprise the error handling.

1. Inside the catch-block in a saga, the ERROR-action should be dispatched. Its payload contains the error and the property operationType, which can be set to "loading" or "saving" - it is used by reducer to set the value of either loadingState or savingState in the activity.
2. If the error is of type ApplicationError, then it is saved by reducer as is. Otherwise, the reducer wraps the error in an ApplicationError with the error code of INTERNAL\_CLIENT\_ERROR.
3. Based on value of operationType, the reducer sets either loadingState or savingState to "error".
4. Components can use this information for example to render some kind of indication, that an error occurred.
5. The error-property can be reset by dispatching the action CLEAR\_ERROR.

#### Built-in Sagas Which Get Triggered by an Action

Below are listed all actions that are consumed by Client built-in sagas. All actions that trigger them are in the namespace "Activity", so for example the action named "PUSH" below has the type "Activity/PUSH". If you want to have a different behavior, you can register your own implementation in the array `overridePlatformSagas` in the Client application setup.

##### Models and Documents

Handle loading of A12 documents and models.

| Triggering action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PUSH` | Executes after the reducer already created a new activity. Dispatches the `LOAD_MODELS`- and `LOAD_DATA`-action if model and/or data loading is required. It also initializes one DataHolder if it is not already existing. This DataHolder’s descriptor is identical to the activity’s descriptor, and we refer to it as the activity DataHolder. If there is an Overview Model specified in the scene for the current activity, this saga also initializes the list parameters like pagination, filter and sorting. |
| `LOAD_MODELS` | Loads all models into the Redux store which are specified in the scene matching the current activity. All referenced Document Models are automatically loaded, so there is no need to additionally specify the referenced Document Model. It only loads models which are not yet in the redux store. |
| `LOAD_DATA` | It performs the data loading for all DataHolders of the current activity whose loading state is `loading`. The loading itself is delegated to the DataHandlers.  If you are using a DataLoader, there is some default behavior implemented within the Client. After the loading, it dispatches a `SET_DATA` action which sets the data in the activity. When a new document is created and the `preComputeNewDocuments` parameter of the `ApplicationSaga.Configuration` object is set to true, computations will be executed before and the calculated document will be set as data of the activity.  If you are using the DataProvider, you have the full control about the data loading operation, e.g. you have to write the loaded data back into the activity’s DataHolder. |
| `SAVE.STARTED` / `COMMIT.STARTED` | If performs the saving of data for the current activity. The saving itself is delegated to the DataHandlers.  If you are using a DataLoader, it dispatches the `SET_DATA`-action for the activity after saving with the data from the save result in the payload. If the activity contains a datasourceActivityId, the `SET_DATA`-action is also dispatched for this activity. It also dispatches a `RELOAD` action for related overview activity if it exists.  If you are using a DataProvider, there is no additional default behavior. The Client simply runs your implemented `provideData` method of the matching DataProvider.  For the `COMMIT.STARTED` action, the activity is cancelled after the saving operation. |
| `REMOVE_DATA` | Calls the delete function of a matching DataHandler for the current activity. If you are using a DataLoader, it also dispatches the `RELOAD`-action for the parent overview-activity and its dependents after the delete operation. |
| `RELOAD` | Locks the activity (by dispatching the `LOCK`-action), dispatches the `LOAD_DATA`-action and then unlocks the activity (by dispatching the `UNLOCK`-action). |

##### Cancellation of Activities

| Triggering action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CANCEL_REQUESTED` | Dispatches a `CANCEL`-action for all activities which are contained in the payload of the action. This saga can be overridden with for example the dirtyHandling-saga which is contained in the extensions of the Client. |

#### ActivitySagas

##### acquireActivityLock

This saga can be used to acquire a lock for an activity. The saga tries to lock an activity until it has the lock or until the activity is not in the store anymore. If the activity is already locked by somebody else, the saga waits for the activity to be unlocked.

The saga has the following signature:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` function acquireActivityLock(activityId: string, owner: string, details: object): SagaIterator<string | undefined> { /* ... */ } ``` |
```

The locks get a unique id which later has to be used to unlock them.

If the saga acquired a lock it returns the lock id. If the activity gets deleted from the store in the process the saga returns "undefined". A caller has to check that the lock id is not undefined before proceeding.

A caller also has to release the lock after it is not needed anymore.

Example usage:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` const lockId = yield call(ActivitySagas.acquireActivityLock, activityId, owner, details); if (lockId === undefined){   // activity with activityId is not in the store anymore, so it makes sense to stop here..   return "failed"; }  // Statements while having the lock  // When you are done, unlock the activity with the lockId yield put(ActivityActions.unlock({activityId: activityId, lockId: lockId})); ``` |
```

#### StoreSagas

##### waitForStateChange

This saga can be used to wait for a specific state change by passing a selector.

The saga has the following signature:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` waitForStateChange<T>: (selector: Selector<{stateChanged: boolean, returnValue: T}>) => SagaGenerator<T>; ``` |
```

The function expects as an argument a selector, which returns an object, which contains the following values:

* stateChange: specifies that the state changed to the desired outcome
* returnValue: a value which gets returned by the selector

The waitForStateChange saga calls the selector on the first call and then after each action which gets dispatched, until the "stateChanged" value is true. In the end the saga returns the "returnValue" to the caller.

Example usage in another saga:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` const returnValue = yield call(StoreSagas.waitForStateChange, mySelector(myArguments)) ``` |
```

### Responsive Application Layout Optimization

There are certain layout optimizations for small window sizes (e.g. an application is opened on a phone device or the browser window is made smaller).

These optimizations apply to the following components in the Client:

* **MasterDetailLayout**: In a large window the MasterDetailLayout shows two panels next to each other, if there is more than one view opened. In a small window the layout shows only one panel.
* **NotificationFrame**: If the application window is large the notifications are shown separately. Otherwise they are stacked.
* **ApplicationFrameLayout**: If the application window is small the mobile navigation behavior ([Mobile Navigation](#features-mobile-navigation)) is enabled.

Furthermore, A12 Engines and Widgets provide layout optimization for small window sizes for certain components as well.

In order to enable these layout optimizations for the whole application (including Engines and Widgets) you need to wrap your application in a React context provider called `SizeContext`. This provider makes the current window size available to all underlying React components.

The following code shows an example of how this should look like:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` export function ResizableApplication(): JSX.Element { 	const { breakPoint } = useWindowSize();  	return ( 		<SizeContext.Provider value={{ currentSize: breakPoint.size }}> 			<MyApplication /> 		</SizeContext.Provider> 	); } ``` |
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you do not wrap your application with the `SizeContext.Provider` there will not be any size detection and a large window will be assumed. There is no fallback to a device detector for Client components. |

### Mobile Navigation

#### General Overview

To be able to navigate backwards in a consistent way on a small device, the `ApplicationFrameLayout` of the Client provides a navigation mechanism to show a back button which either cancels the activities belonging to the currently visible views or expands the sidebar, if it exists.
The back button will be shown as soon as a nested view (e.g. the detail in a Master Detail Layout) is shown or a sidebar is collapsed.

The position and rendering of the back button depends on the used layout.

In the case of a layout which shows multiple views in mobile mode (e.g. DashboardLayout) the ApplicationFrameLayout will render a back button in the navigation bar above the current content.

For layouts only showing one view in mobile mode (e.g. Master Detail), a React context with a `onBackButtonClicked` callback will be created if a back navigation is possible.
Each view is responsible of showing a back button if this callback is given.
More details can be found in the [Mobile Navigation Project setup](#project-setup).

In a multi view layout you also should provide a title for a better navigation experience. This title needs to be given to the `ApplicationFrameLayout` with the prop `navigationBarTitle`.

Furthermore, this feature hides the header and footer of the `ApplicationFrameLayout` as soon as a back-button is shown.

The next section will summarize what you need to do in your project to fully enable mobile navigation.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If you do not want this described behavior, you can disable it by setting the prop `disableMobileNavigation` of the `ApplicationFrameLayout` to `true`. Then no back-button will be displayed and the header as well as the footer will be shown the whole time. |

#### Mobile Navigation Project Setup

##### Application

First of all you need to enable responsive layout optimization for the whole application. See [Responsive Application Layout Optimization](#features-responsive-behavior) for more details.

##### Views

If you use an `ActionContentBox`, you need to set the content box prop `listenToNavigationContext` to true.
If you do not use an ActionContentBox for your view, you need to take care of rendering the button yourself when the `onBackButtonClicked` callback is set.
For this purpose the A12 Widgets library provides a `BackButton` component.
The following code shows how to create the back button which you can then put in the heading of your content box:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` import type { JSX } from "react"; import { useContext } from "react";  import { NavigationContentboxContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/contentbox/main/action-contentbox/action-contentbox.view.js"; import { ContentBoxElements } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/contentbox/main/template/contentbox.tpl.view.js";  export function BackButton(): JSX.Element | null { 	const { onBackButtonClicked } = useContext(NavigationContentboxContext); 	return onBackButtonClicked ? ( 		<ContentBoxElements.BackButton onClick={onBackButtonClicked} /> 	) : null; } ``` |
```

##### Title

If you use a layout which shows more than one view in mobile mode (e.g. Dashboard or Null layout), you should provide a title for the navigation bar, which is shown above the visible content in the `ApplicationFrameLayout`.
You can set the title with the prop `navigationBarTitle` of the `ApplicationFrameLayout`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | You do not need to do this, if you do not use the layout in a nested scenario. Meaning there is no sidebar or other parent activity before. |

##### Custom Layouts

In your custom layouts you need to adapt the layout provider. The declaration of the layout depends on the number of visible views in mobile mode.

###### One View in Mobile Mode

For this case the layout provider needs to return a Layout object, which sets
`visibleViews` to "single" and `getClearedAfterViewIndex` to "views.length - 2".
The getClearedAfterViewIndex tells the `ApplicationFrameLayout` after which view index there is a clear caused by the layout.
The following code shows an example for such a custom layout declaration

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` import type { FrameViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  import { CustomLayoutComponent } from "./CustomLayoutComponent.js";  export const layout: FrameViews.Layout = { 	component: CustomLayoutComponent, 	visibleViews: "single", 	getClearedAfterViewIndex(layoutProps: FrameViews.LayoutProps) { 		return () => { 			if (layoutProps.views.length > 1) { 				return layoutProps.views.length - 2; 			}  			return undefined; 		}; 	} }; ``` |
```

The usage of the properties `visibleViews` and `getClearedAfterViewIndex` is described in more detail in the [API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/typedoc/index.html) about `Layout`.

###### Multiple Views in Mobile Mode

For this case the layout provider needs to return a Layout object, which sets
"visibleViews" to "multiple". Furthermore, if you do not show all available views with your layout, you need to set getClearedAfterViewIndex as well, to define the view index after which the layout causes a clear.

## Architecture

This chapter gives an insight into the A12 Client Architecture.

### Walkthrough

This page gives an overview of the key modules and elements of the Client. The focus is on high-level dependencies and interactions. The following concept map will guide us:

![client-architecture](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/images/walkthrough/client-architecture.svg)

Read the above diagram like this: modules of the Client are in colored boxes. The box title briefly summarizes the responsibility of the module and also relevant technologies used. Go back to [Principles](#/introduction/principles) in the Introduction to see a collapsed diagram of Clients' modules.

#### Activity / Scene / View Cascade

Activities are not directly related to the UI. Actually, you can create activities (through Redux actions) in a *headless* Client application, e.g., when testing on the command line.
Activities relate to UI only through indirection with the so-called **Activity/Scene/View** cascade. This page will give a quick walkthrough of what happens when a new activity is created. The following sections of this chapter contain other detailed walkthroughs for the specifics that we are omitting for now.

1. **Application code** dispatches a Redux action to start a new activity. In the diagram locate the arrow labelled "creates" pointing towards "Activity". For example, when the user clicks on a row in the overview list, the row-selection handler would dispatch this Redux action.
2. The **activity** is created. It contains, among other things:

   * The **Activity Descriptor** (a key/value map with the two pre-defined keys "model" and "instance").

     + The Activity Descriptor is the most relevant part; it denotes the intention of its activity and is then used to select an Application Model [scene](#/basics/application-model/scenes) that changes the UI.
   * data (which might be missing at this point and loaded later from server – by DataLoaders – or from a parent activity – by a DataEditor)
   * Various tracking information like loading state, saving state, processing state, whether the activity is locked or dirty, and also error information.
3. The activity triggers now two actions: data loading (yellow area in the diagram) and UI updates (the blue and green rest in the diagram).

   * The data loading is handled by so-called data-loading sagas, which is a loop that watches for new activities without loaded data. These sagas are registered during application startup. The default sagas delegate the loading (and saving later on) to registered DataLoaders (load/save from server) and DataEditors (read/write from data of a parent activity). The selection is done by inspecting the Activity Descriptor.
4. The **region selector** (in the lower green "frame" module) is called and finds a matching Application Model scene for the Activity Descriptor. The scene contains

   * a match condition that has to be matched against the Activity Descriptor (keys and values to match)
   * a scene change with directives to execute, also an optional default case again with scene changes (not detailed here).
   * Then the directives of the scene change are interpreted and result in a region specification containing the layouts for regions and views in these regions. In the diagram, locate the light blue box "model" just above the green "frame" module.
5. The derived abstract UI structure is now used to render actual UI components via a provider mechanism, that maps names to actual UI components, e.g., a view with name "CRUDOverview" would map to a specific React component.

   * Note that derived abstract UI structure is agnostic to any technology (even does not know about to React).
6. The **layout** is a React component for a region that defines the visual structure of this region. The derived views will be rendered according to its specification and the available placeholders in the respective layouts. For example, the master-detail layout has two placeholders on the desktop and one on mobile devices.

   * Views that are not displayed can be accessed through other means, e.g., a dropdown control that is shown by the layout.
   * Applications are free to define their own layouts.
7. The **UI component** for a view is rendered. There are many predefined views, e.g., for the Engines. Applications are free to define their own views or extend existing ones.

## Recipes

In the following sections we want to share best practices and recipes for developing an A12 Client Application.

### Writing Tests for the Client

#### React Components

We write tests using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). If you were using enzyme before, have a look at [this migration guide](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/migrate-from-enzyme/) as the approach to testing components is different.

#### ActionCreators / Reducers

In Redux, *action creators* are functions which return plain objects. When testing action creators, we want to test whether the correct action creator was called and also whether the right action was returned.

A *reducer* should return the new state after applying the action to the previous state.

Because these functions are pure, they are easy to test without mocking.

##### Example

The following example shows one test case for an action creator.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ``` | ``` import { deepStrictEqual } from "node:assert/strict";  import type { Action } from "typescript-fsa";  import type { AddTodoPayload } from "./action.js"; import { addTodoRequested } from "./action.js";  describe("@com.mgmtp.a12.client.devapp.features.multiple-data-holders", () => { 	describe("ActionCreators", () => { 		describe( 			"When the ActionCreator addTodoRequested is called with " + 				"an activity id list id and a new todo string", 			() => { 				it("creates an action of this type with the given ids and a todo as payload", () => { 					const payload: AddTodoPayload = { 						activityId: "1", 						listId: "A", 						newTodo: "New todo" 					}; 					const expectedAction: Action<AddTodoPayload> = { 						type: addTodoRequested.type, 						payload 					}; 					deepStrictEqual(addTodoRequested(payload), expectedAction); 				}); 			} 		); 	}); }); ``` |
```

#### DataEditor / DataLoader / ModelLoader

Whenever you have to deal with the retrieval and persistence of data or models in your application, it is likely that you get in touch with these components.

The features documentation provides more information about the [DataLoader and DataEditor](#/basics/data-loading). The ModelLoader works quite the same, but is concerned with the retrieval and persistence of models.

When testing these classes, we recommend to use a mocking library.

#### Sagas

Our preferred way of testing sagas is to run the whole saga and assert that the expected effects have occurred.

This approach is also recommended by the official [redux-saga docs](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/advanced/Testing.html).

##### Example

```

## Frequently Asked Questions

Since Client 1.0, we collect questions that are asked frequently. Please address new questions to Technical Professional Services - we will answer them here if they are of general interest.

### General

#### How to Define the Initial Locale of the Application?

This is described in the Section [Localization > Current Locale](#/advanced/localization/current-locale).

#### How to Connect a Different Backend?

Client provides the `DataLoader` API for this purpose. You can register your own loaders in the setup.

Have a look at the integration of the A12 server into the DevApp - it uses the provided connectors which themselves are an extension on top of the core.

#### How to Enable Redux DevTools in the Client?

The Redux DevTools provide a store enhancer which can be passed as parameter when calling the factory function `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup`.
A function creating the enhancer could look like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` import type { ComposeEnhancer } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core";  declare let window: Window & { 	__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__?: ComposeEnhancer; };  /**  * Trick to enable Redux DevTools with TS: see https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-ts  */ export function enableReduxDevTools(): ComposeEnhancer | undefined { 	return typeof window !== "undefined" && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ !== undefined 		? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ 		: undefined; } ``` |
```

#### Why Isn’t There a URL-Based Navigation (Routing) Solution? / How Can I Integrate React Router?

We provide the [Deep Linking](#/features/deep-linking) extension, which enables URL-based state restoration. It should cover basic use cases
of providing links into specific parts of the application.

A more generic Routing solution can not be provided, because Routing works best for more or less static web pages.
In contrast, Client applications usually run multiple or even nested Activities, which handle the state of multiple views on the screen.
Storing the whole state of all Activities in the URL is not feasible for every project.

### Engines

#### How to Render a UI Engine?

The following module from the Application Model contains one scene which renders the Overview Engine for the model `CRUD-overview` when this scene matches an activity with the specified match conditions.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ``` | ``` { 	"name": "CRUD Module", 	"menu": { 		"name": "crud", 		"label": { "en": "CRUD" }, 		"initialActivity": { "descriptor": { "model": "CRUD" } } 	}, 	"flows": [ 		{ 			"name": "CRUD Flow", 			"scenes": [ 				{ 					"name": "CRUD Overview Scene", 					"matchConditions": [ 							{ "key": "model", "mustEqual": "CRUD" }, 							{ "key": "instance", "isSet": false } 					], 					"sceneChange": { 						"onEnter": [ 							{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR" }, 							{ 								"type": "VIEW_ADD", 								"name": "OverviewCRUD", 								"models": [ { "modelType": "overview", "name": "CRUD-overview" } ] 							} 						] 					} 				} 			] 		} 	] } ``` |
```

The Client first loads all models that are listed in all `VIEW_ADD` directives of that scene and puts them into the Redux store. It also loads the referenced models, if these have not already been loaded. In this example, it is the `CRUD-overview` Overview Model as well as the referenced `DomainCRUD` Document Model.

As soon as the relevant models for the specified view `OverviewCRUD` are available, the UI component itself selects the appropriate models from the store and uses them to initialize and render the Overview Engine.

Please keep in mind that each scene working with A12 models requires a key `model`. The value for this `model` key must match the model you specify in the models list of the `VIEW_ADD` directives. Of course, you may add additional Document Models which will be loaded into the store and can be used for project specific operations.

**Remark:** From the `model` key, the Client derives the specific model names (for document and UI models), i.e.

* **Document Model:** `Domain` and the value of the key `model`, e.g. `DomainCRUD`
* **Form Model:** just the value of the key `model`, e.g. `CRUD`
* **Overview Model:** the value of the key `model` and `-overview`, e.g. `CRUD-overview`

#### How to Render 2 UI Engines for Distinct Document Models?

You need to add another scene into your module to render more than one UI engine in the same content area.

You can find an example in the DevApp under `UI Handling > Layouts > Dashboard Layout > Multiple Activities`. The example dashboard contains multiple tiles that rely on different models.

##### DO NOT Add Another `VIEW_ADD` Directive for a Different UI Engine

Please be aware that it is not possible to use just one scene for rendering two UI Engines. You could think that we take the module from above and simply add another `VIEW_ADD` directive, e.g.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ``` | ``` { 	"name": "CRUD Overview Scene", 	"matchConditions": [ 		{ "key": "model", "mustEqual": "CRUD" }, 		{ "key": "instance", "isSet": false } 	], 	"sceneChange": { 		"onEnter": [ 			{ "type": "REGION_CLEAR" }, 			{ 				"type": "VIEW_ADD", 				"name": "OverviewCRUD", 				"models": [ { "modelType": "overview", "name": "CRUD-overview" } ] 			}, 			{ 				"type": "VIEW_ADD", 				"name": "OverviewCRUD", 				"models": [ { "modelType": "overview", "name": "Offer-overview" } ] 			} 		] 	} } ``` |
```

The second `VIEW_ADD` directive wants to initialize the Overview Engine for the `Offer-overview` model which references the `DomainOffer` model.

Note that the match conditions for this overall scene only have one `model` key. Its value is `CRUD`. The Client is not able to successfully render this second Overview Engine, because it expects `CRUD` models and documents.

#### How to Compute Values / Modify Document With Form Engine?

In Client, you should never change the document inside the Form Engine state. It will create an inconsistency between engine and store. Instead, you should change the document in `activity.data` - which in turn should update the engine document. The Form Engine’s internal document should only be used in non-standard based scenarios.

We provide the `FormEngineStateAdapter` exactly for this reason. It allows you to pass a document from the store to the Form Engine. Please refer to the [Form Engine API documentation](https://geta12.com/docs/FORM_ENGINE/formengine-documentation-bundle/index.html#_api_documentation) for more details about the `FormEngineStateAdapter`.

### Performance

#### Common Issues Impacting Performance

##### Dispatching Many Consecutive Actions

This can be problematic when each action triggers a state change and another action, which in turn also changes the state. A typical case is a higher-level saga,
that listens to actions and dispatches additional ones. When each action triggers state change, dispatching the first trigger action will cause a fast cascade of state changes, which
might impact the render time of components that are subscribed on a specific piece of the state.

To resolve these problems, try to reduce the number of state changes by putting as much logic as possible into reducers and use saga/middlewares only where reducers are not possible (for example, network requests or other side effects).
The amount of "work" done in a reducer does not matter, since there will always be only one state change at the end of it.

Apart from performance, this approach also has some other advantages:

* reducers are simple functions and can easily be unit tested
* reducers can easily be composed and therefore reused
* stepping through the code while debugging is easy, because there are no additional "redux effect layers"
* cognitive load is lower for developers reading the code

##### Subscribing to Too Much State

React components should always only subscribe to state changes they are actually interested in. This way, unrelated state changes will cause a re-render.
Consider the following view component:

Using a too generic selector

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export function DisplayActivityLockView(props: View) { 	const activityId = props.activityId;  	// adding a dataHolder to this activity will cause a re-render! 	const activity = useSelector(ActivitySelectors.activityById(activityId));  	return <div>{activity?.lock ? "locked" : "unlocked"}</div>; } ``` |
```

Since the whole activity object is selected from the state, any change to it will trigger a re-render. However, only the `lock` property of the activity is actually used.
Therefore, the component should subscribe to changes from this property only:

Using a specific selector

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` export function DisplayActivityLockView2(props: View) { 	const activityId = props.activityId;  	// only changes to the lock property cause a re-render 	const lock = useSelector(ActivitySelectors.activityPropById(activityId, a => a.lock));  	return <div>{lock ? "locked" : "unlocked"}</div>; } ``` |
```

Now, the component will not re-render when the activity state changes, except for the `lock` property (which is exactly what we want here).

##### Using Unstable References

With React and Redux, its important that references to non primitives (like objects or arrays, but also functions) stay stable (equal by reference) whenever possible.
Therefore reducers and selectors should only return a new value when something actually changed. With arrays and objects in particular, this can be difficult to spot:

Unstable selector

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` interface MyState { 	readonly someArray: string[]; 	readonly someObject: object; 	readonly maybeArray?: string[]; }  /**  * Returns a new reference on each call, meaning for the exact same state:  *  * selectArray(state) !== selectArray(state)  */ export function selectArray(state: MyState): string[] { 	return [...state.someArray]; }  /**  * Returns a new reference on each call, meaning for the exact same state:  *  * selectObject(state) !== selectObject(state)  */ export function selectObject(state: MyState): object { 	return { selected: state.someObject }; } ``` |
```

Since the selector will be called after every state change (regardless of what it will select) and [only checks for referential equality by default](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#equality-comparisons-and-updates), a component using it re-renders on every state change.
This happens because the selector returns a new object on every call.

For these cases, either try to return stable values or use the second parameter of `useSelector` to pass a custom equality function.

Stable selector

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` /**  * Returns the array as it is.  *  * NOTE: the reducer is responsible to only change the reference when needed!  * In that case, for the exact same state:  *  * selectArray2(state) === selectArray2(state)  */ export function selectArray2(state: MyState): string[] { 	return state.someArray; }  /**  * Returns the object as it is.  *  * NOTE: the reducer is responsible to only change the reference when needed!  * In that case, for the exact same state:  *  * selectObject2(state) === selectObject2(state)  */ export function selectObject2(state: MyState): object { 	return state.someObject; } ``` |
```

While the example above is only for illustrative purposes, a more common real-word scenario is a selector that returns an empty array/object. Consider this code:

Real-world example

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` /**  * Returns an array property as is, but provides a fallback in case it doesn't exist.  *  * Since the empty array is defined inline, the return value will not be stable when  * `maybeArray` does not exist!  */ export function selectMaybeArray(state: MyState): string[] { 	return state.maybeArray ?? []; }  /**  * Returns an array property as is (it could be undefined).  * Any fallback can be done by the caller.  *  * Since `undefined` is a primitive, the return value is stable.  */ export function selectMaybeArray2(state: MyState): string[] | undefined { 	return state.maybeArray; } ``` |
```

##### Using Context

Every time the value of a React context changes, the children of the context provider will re-render.
Therefore the same principle as above applies here. The context value needs to be stable and only return a new value when something actually changed.

Also note that `useContext` on its own does not provide a custom equality function.

#### How to Analyze

Its recommended to install the [React developer tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).

##### Visualize Renderings

The developer tools extension can be configured to visualizing any rendering by highlighting the affected component(s).
You can find the setting under "General → Highlight updates when components render"

Note that this displays **any** rendering, including the valid ones. Therefore this should only be used in cases where you don’t expect any renderings and
want to check the impact of a state change.

##### Use the Devtools Profiler

The developer tools extension provides a Profiler panel that records all renders when running.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Make sure to activate "Record why each component rendered while profiling." in the settings of the Profiler. |

While recording, perform the "problematic" state changes to trigger rendering. Afterwards, the extension will display
each render cycle and the components that were affected. In case your profile contains lots of unrelated/unproblematic renders (very short ones),
they can be excluded via the setting "Hide commits below".

When clicking on a component, the cause of the rendering and its time should be displayed. When identifying "slow" renders, check whether the rendering is expected (for example, a Modal component rendering the first time after the user clicked a confirm button).
If it is, check the render logic of the React component to identify any blocking code paths. If not, try optimizing the component based on the cause (for example with memoizing or by stabilizing any selectors)

##### Setup Programmatic Profiling

This can be done with the [React Profiler directly in the code](https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler) or by using external libraries like [WhyDidYouRender](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render). These libraries hook into React internals to track any changes, including any unwanted re-renderings.
This approach allows you to set up unit tests for common performance problems.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Note that tools like WhyDidYouRender rely on using internal code of React, which might break with a new React release. This needs to be taken into account when upgrading. |

## Troubleshooting

### Initial Activity Does Not Load Correctly

When your Application Model contains an initial activity that performs model loading, please check whether your Model Graph is setup correctly and whether you are using the correct trigger action.
See [the documentation about the Deep Linking Feature](#/features/deep-linking/welcome-page) for details.

### Client-Internal Actions Seem to Have No Effect

If Client-internal behavior does not work the way you are used to (e.g. data loading is not triggered after "loadData" is dispatched, activities are not canceled after "cancel" is dispatched etc…​), please check if all of your registered Data Reducers (specified via Application Setup or [Module API](#/advanced/module-api)) are written correctly.
Take a look at [the documentation about Data Reducers](#/basics/adding-data-reducer) for an example and to know what to look out for.

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be found [here](https://geta12.com/docs/2025.06/ext5/client/client-documentation-bundle/assets/typedoc/index.html).

## Breaking Change Management

The client library follows the general [A12 breaking change interpretation](https://geta12.com/docs/overall/breaking_change_management), but has the following exceptions:

* Adding new keys to the localization resource key objects is not considered a breaking change.

  Otherwise, it would not be possible to provide overridable default translations for texts in components introduced with new optional features.

  Compile errors resulting from this should point consumers to missing translations in locales without default translations.

## Migration Instructions

The following sections contain migration instructions, starting from Client 15 (2024.06) to the latest version. For the migration from older versions, please refer to the Client documentation of A12 version 2024.06.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The complete list of changes for the A12 Client can be found in the [changelog](https://geta12.com/#/releases/releases-overview/client). |

### Application Model Migration Tool

To migrate your Application Models, first install or update the migration tool with

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npm install -g @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-application-model-migration ``` |
```

Then run the following command to perform the migration:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` client-application-model-migration <path to appModel files> -b ``` |
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to perform the migration directly:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` npx @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-application-model-migration <path to appModel files> -b ``` |
```

Note that if the given path points to a directory instead, it will be searched recursively for Application Models to migrate. In case you do not have your Application Models under version control, you can set the optional `-b` flag to create backups of your models. Use the `-h` flag to display all available options.

### 2025.06-ext4

#### Changes to Experimental features

##### Removed 'label' property from NullLayout and DashboardLayout Settings

We removed the experimental 'label' property from the settings of Null- and Dashboard-Layouts. These settings were not used by their respective implementations. In case you used them, you can remove these settings from your Application Model. To do that, check your LayoutProvider implementation to figure out which names corresponds to our NullLayout and DashboardLayout.

#### Deprecation

##### Deep import paths of A12 Client npm packages

Nested imports from the npm packages `@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core` and `@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-data` (e.g. `@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/application/index.js`)
are now deprecated in favor of top-level imports to avoid unnecessary breaking changes and reduce ongoing maintenance effort.

The ability to use the old-style ("long") imports will be removed in the next breaking release.

To migrate, first install or update the codemod with your preferred package manager, e.g. with `pnpm`:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` pnpm install -g @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-codemod ``` |
```

Then run the specific recipe:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` client-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json>  // or as a single command pnpm dlx @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-codemod preferTopLevel <path to directory with tsconfig.json> ``` |
```

For further details, run the codemod with the `--help` flag.

### 2025.06-ext2

#### Deprecation of widgetMap props

Customizing the rendered A12 Widgets for certain Client components via the `widgetMap` property is deprecated starting with Client 16.1.0. Instead, use the `ClientWidgetMapContext` to customize A12 Widgets rendered by Client.
For example, when customizing the MasterDetail widget with the widgetMap property like so:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` const customWidgetMap: FrameViews.MasterDetailLayoutProps["widgetMap"] = { 	masterDetail: CustomMasterDetail };  export function CustomResizableMasterDetailLayout( 	props: FrameViews.MasterDetailLayoutProps ) { 	return <FrameViews.MasterDetailRegionLayout {...props} widgetMap={customWidgetMap} />; } ``` |
```

You can instead wrap the outer component with the `ClientWidgetMapContext` and pass your custom widget there:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ``` | ``` import { useContext } from "react"; import { ClientWidgetMapContext } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/ClientWidgetMap.js";  export function CustomResizableMasterDetailLayout( 	props: FrameViews.MasterDetailLayoutProps ) { 	const DefaultClientWidgetMap = useContext(ClientWidgetMapContext);  	const customWidgetMap = { 		...DefaultClientWidgetMap, 		MasterDetail: CustomMasterDetail 	};  	return ( 		<ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider value={customWidgetMap}> 			<FrameViews.MasterDetailRegionLayout {...props} /> 		</ClientWidgetMapContext.Provider> 	); } ``` |
```

#### Deprecation of ProgressIndicatorComponent property

The property `ProgressIndicatorComponent` used to customize the `ProgressIndicator` of the `ViewViews.ProgressIndicator` component is deprecated starting with Client 16.1.0. The migration path is the same as described above for the `widgetMap` property.
You can use the `ClientWidgetMapContext` from Client and customize the `ProgressIndicator` widget instead.

#### Changes to Experimental features

##### Extended ActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload with Model References and Model Graph

The experimental interface `ActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload` (along with its async counterpart, their type guards and the `extractModelsInScenePayload` helper) was moved from the `ActivityActions` namespace of the `activity` module to the `model` module.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` // OLD import { type ActivityActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/activity/index.js"; type P = ActivityActions.ActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload  // NEW import { type ActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/model/index.js"; ``` |
```

Additionally, it was extended to contain **all** referenced models in the current scene (not only the **loaded** ones). Additionally, the Model Graph is now part of the payload as well to be able to work with model descriptors (for example, finding references from the header).

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` export interface ActivityActionWithModelsInScenePayload extends ActivityActionPayload {  	//readonly modelsInScene: ModelAPI[]; // <- OLD  	readonly modelsInScene: ReferencedModel.Instance[]; // <- NEW 	readonly modelGraph: ModelGraph; // <- NEW } ``` |
```

Note that the type of each referenced model depends on its loading state, meaning each element in `modelsInScene` is now either:

* the already loaded model
* a model error, when loading was already attempted and failed
* a model descriptor, when the model was not loaded yet (in this case the Model Graph could be used, e.g. to find references)

Additionally, the `direct` property of a referenced model can be used to distinguish between:

* models that are part of a scene because they were explicitly specified in it (`direct: true`)
* models that are part of a scene because they are transitively referenced via other models (`direct` property is not set)

When you use `modelsInScene` to iterate over available references, you will now need to either:

* filter out only the loaded references (if thats all you’re interested in) or
* handle the other types as well and
* check for the `direct` property (if you want to treat `modelsInScene` as in "models directly set in the scene" and not as "all models that are part of the scene")

Type Guards for the different reference types are provided as part of the `ReferencedModel` namespace.

##### Removed canHandleAsync from DataProvider

The experimental method `canHandleAsync` was removed from the `DataProvider` interface because it introduces stack overflow errors when using a large number of Data Providers and/or Data Holders.
In order to still fulfill the original use case of `canHandleAsync` (being able to limit the scope of a Data Provider based on the presence of models in the scene), the `canHandle` method now receives the triggering action as well.

To stay non-breaking, `action` is added as an optional property to the `DataProvider.CanHandleConfig` interface, which now looks like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` export interface CanHandleConfig { 	readonly activityId: string; 	readonly operation: Operation; 	readonly dataHolder: Activity.DataHolder;  	readonly activities: ActivityMap;  	readonly action?: ActivityActions.DataReducerAction; // <- NEW } ``` |
```

The migration path depends on your logic implemented in `canHandleAsync`:

###### No Saga Effects

If you implemented `canHandleAsync` without using any kind of effect, you can simply put the logic in the normal `canHandle` (which has the same parameters, but is just a "normal" function).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | When you only use the `select` effect, check whether the data you’re selecting is available from the config parameter directly. In these cases, you can also just move the implementation to `canHandle` and replace the "selecting" logic. Consider this example:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` *canHandleAsync(config: DataProvider.CanHandleConfig): SagaGenerator<boolean> { 	const instance = yield* select( 			ActivitySelectors.activityPropById( 				config.activityId, 				activity => activity.descriptor.instance 			) 		);  	return instance !== undefined; } ``` | ```  Here, we only want to handle a data holder when its activity has an instance set. However, since `activities` is a property of `CanHandleConfig`, this can be refactored to a normal `canHandle`:  ``` |  |  | | --- | --- | | ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` canHandle(config: DataProvider.CanHandleConfig): boolean { 	const { activityId, activities } = config;  	const activity = activities[activityId];  	return activity?.descriptor.instance !== undefined; } ``` | ``` |

###### Accessing Models In Scene

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | The import path for the `extractModelsInScenePayload` helper and its return value was changed slightly. See [here](#/experimentalChanges/payload) |

When you used `canHandleAsync` to be able to select the models of the current scene, use the new action property in `canHandle` to access them. Consider this example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` import { select, type SagaGenerator } from "typed-redux-saga";  import { type DataProvider } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/data/index.js"; import { ModelSelectors } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/model/index.js";  const myProvider: DataProvider = { 	name: "MyProvider", 	canHandle(): boolean { 		return false; // not used because we implemented canHandleAsync 	}, 	*canHandleAsync(config: DataProvider.CanHandleConfig): SagaGenerator<boolean> { 		const models = yield* select(ModelSelectors.modelDescriptorsByActivityId(config.activityId));  		return models.some(({ modelType }) => modelType === "<some a12 model type>"); 	}, 	*provideData(): SagaGenerator<void> { /* impl */ } }; ``` |
```

This Data Provider wants to handle data holders where the activity contains a specific A12 model in its scene. Since this was not possible before using just `canHandle`, `canHandleAsync` was implemented.

However, this use case can now be solved with the normal `canHandle` method by accessing the payload of the triggering action:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` import { type SagaGenerator } from "typed-redux-saga";  import { isModelInstance } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.base/base-model-api/lib/main/model/index.js";  import { type DataProvider } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/data/index.js"; import { ActivityActions } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/activity/index.js";  export const myProvider: DataProvider = { 	name: "MyProvider", 	canHandle({ action }: DataProvider.CanHandleConfig): boolean { 		const { modelsInScene } = ActivityActions.extractModelsInScenePayload(action) ?? {};  		return modelsInScene?.some( 			m => (isModelInstance(m) ? m.header.modelType : !Model.Error.isInstance(m) ? m.modelType : undefined) === "<some a12 model type>" 		) ?? false; 	}, 	*provideData(): SagaGenerator<void> { /* impl */ } }; ``` |
```

Here, we can first use the convenience type guard from the `ActivityActions` namespace to extract the models in scene from the action payload before searching them for our specific type.
Note that the type of each element in `modelsInScene` depends on the loading state (so in our example, we check the `modelType` property from the header if the model already exists, otherwise we access the `modelType` property of its descriptor).

###### Accessing Other State / Using Other Effects

If you used effects other than `select` or accessed any other state (that is not available via the config parameters) in your `canHandleAsync` implementation, you need to refactor your Data Provider and/or the action that triggers it.
Note that the triggering action (e.g. `loadData`) gets passed to `canHandle`, which means you could use its payload to make additional data available there (like A12 Client does internally with the models in the scene).

##### How to define the rootReducer

Previously, if you provided a rootReducer to Client, you had to create the default rootReducer yourself. If your appsetup defined 'reducerMap' and 'dataReducers', they had to be integrated into the rootReducer yourself via the 'createRootReducer' function and the Client was ignoring these parameters.

Now, the default rootReducer is created by Client again, passed to you and you have the option to customize or to ignore it. 'createRootReducer' is removed from the public API. Make sure to add 'reducerMap' and 'dataReducers' back to the appsetup, if you removed them.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` // OLD const defaultRootReducer = createRootReducer(otherConfig.reducerMap, otherConfig.dataReducers);  const customRootReducer: Reducer<object> = (state, action) => { 		switch (action.type) { 			case "CUSTOM_ACTION": { 				return { ...state, custom: true }; 			} 			default: 				return defaultRootReducer(state, action); 		} 	};  // NEW const customRootReducer: (defaultReducer: Reducer<object>) => Reducer<object> = 	defaultReducer => (state, action) => { 		switch (action.type) { 			case "CUSTOM_ACTION": { 				return { ...state, custom: true }; 			} 			default: 				return defaultReducer(state, action); 		} 	}; ``` |
```

### 2025.06

#### Breaking Changes

##### Integration of Dependencies

The versions of the A12 dependencies were increased. Please check the documentation of the respective components for further migration instructions.

##### App Model Migration

For the following change, the App Model version was increased. Please refer to the general [Application Model migration](#/migration/application-model) section to find out how to perform the migration.

##### Removed OnExit Directive From App Model Cases

The ability to set an `onExit` directive for **cases** was removed from the Application Model, because while the typing allowed it, the runtime code never evaluated these directives.
You therefore should not encounter any change in behavior after migrating your models.

Note that the `onExit` directive for **scenes** was not changed and works as before. See the [documentation about scenes](#/basics/application-model/scene-changes) for more information.

##### Removal Of Deprecated FrameProgressIndicator API

Following their [deprecation](https://geta12.com/docs/2024.06/ext0/CLIENT/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_frameprogressindicator_propstype) in Client 15, the namespace `FrameProgressIndicator` and the ability to pass in predicates to the factory `FrameFactories.createProgressComponentProvider` were removed. Please see the deprecation notes for motivation.

If you want to make the loading state dependent on more then just the `busy` flag (which is the default), you need to write a custom `ProgressIndicator` component and extract the information from the activity by a selector directly and evaluate it.

Consider this example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` | ``` import type { Activity } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/activity"; import { FrameFactories } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/frame";  function isFirstDataHolderEmpty(a: Activity): boolean { 	return a.dataHolders.at(0)?.data === undefined; }  FrameFactories.createProgressComponentProvider([isFirstDataHolderEmpty]) ``` |
```

Here, the `predicates` parameter was used to express a loading state while the first DataHolder of the activity has no data.

When migrating, this predicate function can be reused by calling it inside a selector, e.g. like this:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 ``` | ``` import { ActivitySelectors } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/activity"; import { ViewViews, type View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/view";  function CustomProgressComponent({ activityId, children }: View.ProgressComponentProvider.PropsType) { 	const customCondition = useSelector(ActivitySelectors.activityPropById(activityId, isFirstDataHolderEmpty))  	return ( 		<ViewViews.ProgressIndicator progress={customCondition ? "loading" : "none"}> 			{children} 		</ViewViews.ProgressIndicator> 	); }  // instead of the default factory, provide your custom component ``` |
```

By extracting the relevant information inside the selector, your component will only re-render when necessary (for this example, when the data state of the DataHolder changes).

##### Type-Only Exports Are Now Marked As Such

A12 Client now correctly exports all type-only APIs using the `type` keyword, which can improve bundling. While there is no change in functionality, this may be a breaking change for some of your import statements, depending on how you create type aliases.

Consider the following example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` | ``` import { DataProvider } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/data";  // creating a type alias type DataProviderConfig = DataProvider.CanHandleConfig;  // different syntax, same result! import CanHandleConfig = DataProvider.CanHandleConfig ``` |
```

Using the second syntax (creating a type alias via the `import` keyword) will not work anymore for the following APIs:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` import { ApplicationSaga } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/application"; import { DataEditor, DataProvider } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/data"; import { ModelResult } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/model"; import { View } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/view"; ``` |
```

To migrate these cases, simply use the first syntax instead (creating a type alias via the `type` keyword).

###### Codemod command

A codemod command is provided to rewrite all of the affected import statements. Make sure to review the changes after running it.

To run the command, run `npx @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-codemod imports <tsConfigDir>`.

##### Removed Container API

The experimental `configuration` package of Client, most notably including the `Container` API, was removed to reduce dependencies.
There is no new API as replacement. Instead, existing A12 APIs can be used.

###### Locales

The available locales of the application now need to be set as a property for the `LocaleSelect` component. For example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` import { LocaleSelect } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/frame";  const APP_LOCALES = [ 	Locale.fromString("de_DE") as Locale, 	Locale.fromString("en_US") as Locale ];  function CustomLocaleSwitcher(): JSX.Element { 	return <LocaleSelect locales={APP_LOCALES} />; } ``` |
```

When passing an initial locale to `ApplicationFactories.createApplicationSetup`, make sure to also include that locale here.

###### Logging

The logging strategy can be set using the `utils-logging` library. See the documentation there for more information. For example:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` import { Settings } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.utils/utils-logging/lib/Settings";  Settings.LogStrategy = new MyCustomStrategy();  // to restore the default Settings.resetLogStrategy(); ``` |
```

###### UI Settings

Settings for the Progress Indicator can be set as properties on the React component. The migration depends on whether you already customized the `ProgressIndicator` component from the `ViewViews` namespace:

* if yes, add your custom UI Setting properties directly on the component
* otherwise: write your own `ProgressIndicator` component and render it in your application setup. See the following code for an example, where all three properties of the `UISettings` object are customized:

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ``` | ``` import type { JSX } from "react"; import { ViewViews } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core/lib/core/view"; import type { ProgressIndicatorProps } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/progress-indicator/main/progress-indicator.api"; import { ProgressIndicator } from "@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/progress-indicator/main/progress-indicator.view";  // somewhere in your render tree function CustomProgressIndicator(): JSX.Element { 	return ( 		<ViewViews.ProgressIndicator 			progress="loading" 			ProgressIndicatorComponent={CustomWidget} 			labelKey="customLabelKey" 		/> 	); }  // customizing the actual indicator widget function CustomWidget(props: ProgressIndicatorProps): JSX.Element { 	const customFastAppear = true; 	const customDelay = 100;  	return <ProgressIndicator {...props} fastAppear={customFastAppear} openingDelay={customDelay} />; } ``` |
```

###### Codemod command

A codemod command is provided to help with the migration of common usage patterns of the `Container` API. Note that depending of the usage,
the command might not be able to migrate all instances completely. Make sure to review the changes after running it.

To run the command, run `npx @com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-codemod container <tsConfigDirectory>`.

The command will try migrating the following patterns:

* bind locales: removed. When the `LocaleSelect` component is used, the locales will be set as a prop there.
* unbind locales: removed
* bind or rebind logging strategy: The logging strategy will be set with the utils-logging API instead.
* unbind logging strategy: The logging strategy will be set to a noop (via utils-logging API).

##### Migration to ESM

The npm artifacts `@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-core` and `@com.mgmtp.a12.client/client-application-model-migration` were migrated from CommonJS to [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules). When using Node `22.12+` and modern build tools, there should be no changes necessary to your bundler setup.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | If your tests depend on mocking/stubbing Client API, consult the documentation of your test runner on how to work with ES modules. |

Migrating your own application to ESM is not required, but recommended. Consult the documentation of your bundler for specifics.

##### Updating to ES2024

The javascript output of the npm artifacts was updated from `ES2020` to `ES2024` to be able to use latest language features. When using supported browsers, there is no change necessary. If support for older browsers is required, make sure to include necessary polyfills.

##### React 19

We dropped the support for React 18 and older and now require React 19 as our peerDependency. This means you have to perform the React 19 migration, which is described in great detail in the official [React 19 Upgrade Guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide). They have codemods that should make the transition straightforward.

As a result of the upgrade, there are some small breaking changes in our API. They only affect you, if you customize Client specific React components.

* props typed as React.MutableRefObject are now typed as React.RefObject

  + Normal ref objects are now mutable. You can safely update the type, there is no change in functionality.
* props typed as React.ReactElement are now implicitly typed as React.ReactElement<unknown> instead of the previous default React.ReactElement<any>

  + This should only be a problem, if you do component introspection to get the components props. This is a highly discouraged pattern. If you insist on doing this, you have to write type guards for the props.

Additionally, we have decided to not also include a Redux update, to minimize the migration effort. The "react-redux" library does not have React 19 as a peerDependency, but still works fine with it. One solution is to override the dependency in your package.json. You also have to update the corresponding "@types/react-redux" typings to at least 7.1.34.

```
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ``` | ``` { 	"overrides": { 		"react-redux": { 			"react": "^19" 		} 	}, 	"devDependencies": { 		"@types/react-redux": 7.1.34 	} } ``` |
```

##### Removal of Static-Page Extension

Following its deprecation in A12 Client 15.2.0, the static-page extension is now removed, including:

* the typing for the `StaticPageExternalViewProvider`
* the namespace object `StaticPageFactories` and all of its properties (the ViewProvider and the factory functions)

Note that there is no direct replacement. For detailed migration instructions, see the [deprecation](https://geta12.com/docs/2024.06/ext0/CLIENT/client-documentation-bundle/index.html#_deprecation_static-page) note.

##### Removal of ActivitiesView from VetoDialog

Following its deprecation in A12 Client 14.3.0, the activitiesView property of the VetoDialog is now removed, including the L10N key unsavedOrLockedActivities.

Note that there is no replacement, since the VetoDialog was generalized. If you would want to customize this dialog, you would have to implement your own.
